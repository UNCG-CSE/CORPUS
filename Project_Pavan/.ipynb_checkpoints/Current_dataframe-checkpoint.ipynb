       "   u'Content': u'---Update 12/18/2013 - I\\'ve moved all \"updates\" to the end of this review for easier reading---My main reason for buying this tablet was/is to use it for taking lecture notes and reading books (college/work/technical books). I wanted something more portable than the Note 10.1 and this seemed to fill the void.Since this product has only been out for a day (when this review was written), I\\'ve had a chance to play with most of the features but not all.  This review is meant for those of you hanging on the fence, unsure of whether or not this tablet will work for you.First off, to save yourself some time, if you have no intentions of using the stylus for taking notes or modifying photos then stop reading this right now. The stylus IS the reason this tablet costs more than the competition and in my opinion it\\'s worth the price.  Yes, there are more powerful tablets out there that are much cheaper but they don\\'t have a stylus!  This tablet is designed for the person who likes to read/write and/or do artwork/photo-shopping.  If you don\\'t need a stylus then you don\\'t need to read this review (look at other products like the Nexus 7).The Pros: Taking notes on this device is a dream (very precise, even for mathematicians)-The hand-writing recognition feature is pretty darn accurate-I can use Microsoft OneNote to take notes (yay!) See \"comments\" section for more info on this(page 2)-Supports a 64GB micro-SD card (search Amazon for the Samsung card)-The interface is snappy and the graphics are fluid (for the most part)-Internet browsing and switching between programs is quick and smooth-The device is easy to hold and is very lightweight-The image quality is crisp, clear and bright-Did I mention, I really love the pen and it\\'s ability to glide across the screen effortlessly?-The infrared remote feature is pretty slick and worked with my Panasonic T.V. without issue-Comes with 50GB dropbox account (for storing and sharing files with others)-Includes a $25 Google Play credit for downloading apps-Very quick to charge (roughly 2 hours)-Plastic finish is very slick and clean - Metal bends and scratches so pick your poisonThe Cons:-The price should be lowered by about $50 in my opinion because of the weak video card (see below)-The device comes with Android 4.1.x and not 4.2.x (Samsung hasn\\'t announced when they will release the \"much improved\" update)***This no longer applies as I\\'ve found an app to replace this missing functionality*** -The following is a negative regarding Android and not the actual device: I made the mistake of buying a 64GB micro-SD card thinking I could store applications and games on it. Turns out, Android stripped out this feature and you can only put pictures, music and other \"documents\" on SD cards. So in short, the included 16GB of storage runs out before you know it (for power users). Save yourself the money, don\\'t buy an SD-Card and use the DropBox service for storing all of your files-The graphics card is kind of weak for playing graphic intensive games but this tablet isn\\'t really meant for that. For example, I played \"Real Racing 3\" and my framerate was probably 20-30 FPS. Still playable but kind of choppy. Additionally, when I unlock the screen with the stylus, the \"ink\" effect can be sluggish at times with a noticeable frame rate drop. Maybe an update will fix this.-Not really a con but lack of color selection(white)is kind of weak if you ask me - This can be fixed by putting it in a case.Overall: I bought this device to take notes and it does that VERY well. I can write complex math formulas and draw nearly anything I can think of without pixelation issues or accuracy problems.  The stylus IS the reason to buy this tablet. Don\\'t go off of the specs or other reviewers who have emotional feelings toward this device.  If you\\'re serious about taking notes (college students and corporate employees), reading e-books and playing the occasional YouTube videos and browsing the internet, you found your golden nugget. I did A LOT of research to find a replacement for my convertible-laptop (stylus enabled laptop) and I believe the Galaxy Note 8 was the right choice.I looked at the competition, even in the $1,000 price range and ultimately I chose this device. My complaint about the graphics card was to iterate the fact that this is not meant for hardcore gaming. Yes it will play Angry Birds and those other cheesy games but don\\'t expect this to replace your IPad 3 or your modern smartphone. The graphic cards on those devices are way more powerful than what this little guy packs.After thoughts: For what it\\'s worth, you can go to Best Buy and purchase the tablet. If you think it\\'s not right for you, you have 15 days to return it and get a 100% refund. If you\\'re a \"Silver\" status member at Best Buy, you get 60 days to try it out. After using it for just one day, I\\'m sold on the device and plan on keeping it. Your mileage might very. But I believe the portability and the note taking features of this device far out-way the cons. Other reviewers compare this tablet to other tablets that don\\'t even have a stylus. That\\'s just not fair. That\\'s like me comparing a wheel-chair (which has a specific purpose) to a bicycle (which has a different purpose). Yes, both will get you around but they are designed for specific needs and I personally feel that the Note 8 will satisfy those looking for a stylus enabled tablet at an affordable price.**Updates to my review*****Update as of 7/1/2013*** Please see below for my actual review - I just wanted to let others know that my experience with this tablet has been great with no problems. For what it\\'s worth, I am left handed and I have no problems with the built-in S-Note application (or any application) for that matter. My hand does not bump into things and I believe this tablet was made to accommodate both left and right hand users (despite the storage location of the pen).***Update as of 6/3/2013*** Apparently the comments section is so long, users have stopped reading the How-to\\'s and have asked me how to use the microSD card for external/internal storage. Here\\'s a quick excerpt so you don\\'t have to dig through the comments:1. Firstly, you need to root your device which is VERY easy - Download and run an app called \"Framaroot-1.4.apk\" - Here is where I downloaded it from:[...]3. You can also follow these instructions for rooting your device:[...]3. Download one of the apps from the Google Play store and read the program\\'s descriptions. It should walk you through the whole setup process.Root External 2 Internal - [...]or...GL to SDHope that helps!***Update as of 5/23/2013*** If I haven\\'t covered something here or in the \"comments\" section, feel free to drop me a question in the comments section and I\\'ll do my best to help you out. Thanks again for all the \"Helpful\" ratings you\\'ve given me. It makes me happy to know I\\'ve helped some of you. I understand I can\\'t please everyone so keep your negative comments to yourself please :-)***Update as of 5/7/2013*** Attention U.S.A. owners of the Galaxy Note 8. While we all know the U.S. version didn\\'t get phone capabilities (3G data), I found an app on the Google Play Store (free) that allows you to make and receive phone calls for free. All you need is a wifi internet connection (Starbucks, your home wifi, etc) to place calls, and a Google Voice account (free). Firstly, go set up a free Google Voice account so you can get your free phone number (do a search on Google for \"Google Voice\".) Lastly, download the following app from the Google Play Store: \"Groove IP Lite\". When you run Groove IP, the application will want to link itself to your Google Voice number (assuming you set this up) and the rest is very seamless. The app allows you to use a Bluetooth device for making calls or the built in speakerphone. Enjoy!***Update as of 5/6/2013*** Look at the last page of the \"comments\" section for my instructions on installing flash and rooting the device. I\\'ve posted instructions on how to install Flash and root your device. I had too many emails to respond to so here ya go!***Update as of 4/25/2013*** I have found an app on the Google Play store that will allow you to use your micro-SD card as the \"internal\" storage and it\\'s free. Additionally, after reading some tech articles, I figured out how to get Flash working on this device along with being able to quickly, safely and easily root the device. If you want more details, post your contact info in the comments section and I\\'ll email you whatever it is you\\'re after. I\\'m afraid Amazon will delete this review if I post links to 3rd party sites.***Update as of 4/23/2013*** I still love the Note 8 and highly recommend it. If you have any questions that I don\\'t answer in this review, feel free to comment and I\\'ll respond back to you when I can. Thanks for all the \"Helpful\" votes!',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I have had the Galaxy Note 8.0 for a week now and decided to share my thoughts. I come from a heavy iOS/OSX background owning Ipad3,ipad Mini and Macbook air. This is my first Android tablet . I also own a Sony Xperia Ray android phone but use it mainly as phone. I also bought Xperia Tablet Z recently and had to return due to build issues after few weeks .. I won't get into specs or detailed reviews ( there are quite a few good ones out there) but will list out why i chose Galaxy Note 8.0Build : Everyone is complaining about the plastic build of Galaxy note 8. It is actually very solid and has no squeaks. The backplate gives a little when you push it. However most will use a case to put their tablets so this is a non issue. the white plastic looks classy. Also as this is plastic the Wifi and bluetooth connections are solid. I get min 4 bars even in bedroom with router in living room. Compared this to ipad mini barely went upto 2 bars. Sony Xperia Tablet z was terrible ..It dropped connections so often it was unusable . However not a big fan of where power button and vol buttons are . I would have preferred  power button on top and vol button on left so when i hold tablet they don't get pressed accidentally as this tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode. Also love the physical home button ( I think this because of habit i guess all Apple devices have them :) ). This tablet also weighs as much the ipad mini and Xperia tablet Z so it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand for long hrs.Display : Even though the display is 1280x800 the display is very crisp. Movies and pictures look really great and text looks real good at decent reading distance. The display is way better than Ipad Mini but little bit lower than Xperia tablet Z which is 1080P. However i prefer the Galaxy note 8.0 display as it is easy on eyes. The colors popped so much on Xperia tablet Z it hurt my eyes. Small text ( try msn.com website) looks bit bad when you look closely . But you would never use tablet close to eyes anyways.Battery life : I get about 2-3 days on single charge with moderate use browsing internet, watching YouTube, some games etc. Mind you I keep brightness to 25% , Bluetooth and GPS off , app notifications off. This decent but not as good as iPad mini.SDXC card extension : This was the biggest sell for me. I bought a Sandisk 64 GB class 10 SD card and put about 40 movies on it and my books and i am all set for long trips. None of the ipads have the feature.Non Propriety port: The charge port is micro USB. So with my universal USB charger i just need to carry one cable that will allow me to charge my MP3 player, my tablet, my cell phone and my portable amp as all use micro usb port. Reduced the clutter of cables i need to carry when i travelForm factor : I was a big fan of Ipad mini for its form factor. I tried to use 10.1 inch tablet ( Sony Xperia Tablet Z) even though light became cumbersome after holding in hand for more than 30 mins. The 7 inch is too small , 10.1 inch too big , 8 inches just perfect for both reading books and watching movies. However i do prefer the 4:3 format of Ipad  mini Vs 16:9 format of Android tablets.Multi tasking : This is brilliant feature and this device allows to have two applications next to each other . This is good when you want to take notes and when browsing a website or a doc . Also the performance is so good there is zero lag even with 6 applications open in background. Ipad doesn't have true multi tasking and there was lag on Sony Xperia tablet Z even though it is high powered device. However that may be due to Sony's bad skinning of jelly beanPerformance/Touch Wiz : Samsung has heavily skinned jelly bean with touch wiz. However there is no lag as this tablet has gobs of power . The 2 GB RAM and quad core processor keep this humming along. I had sometimes 6 applications running in background which were cpu heavy but no lag or abrupt app closures. With Ipad mini apps sometime closed abruptly due to aggressive memory management. iOS is one of the best tuned OS and uses the HW properly . Android still needs horse power to run smoothly.Speakers : They are placed in the same way it is on ipad mini. I like that because when i watch movies in landscape mode the sound is more rounded as my palms cup them. The are loud but not quite as loud as Ipad mini but way better than the ones on sony Xperia Tablet Z. The sound is loud enough to hear in a noisy env. I will not use the tablet for music as i have a very good Sony mp3 player with amp .. So the speakers are only for you tube videos or movies . Mostly i will use headphones anywaysIR blaster : IMO this is just a gimmick. The Watch on and Peel work for me only if i point my tablet at  proper angle to the device it is controlling. The app has so little features. The one implemented on Sony Xperia Tablet Z is awesome. It recognized all my HT components complex menu options and controlled them without me having to point the tablet accurately at the device . However i am hoping someone will come up with an awesome remote appS Pen : This feature is new to me so i am completely fascinated by the tech. It recognizes my handwriting well and i am using it regularly for my meetings ( Handwriting to text mode) . Need to play lot more with it but love the ability to do this . Not many tablets have thisPrice : I think it is reasonably priced ( I bought mine for $379) for features and functions it provides. people don't seem to mind exorbitant prices apple charges for their devices because they are cool :) . Spen , SDXC extension, touchwiz all makes this tablet worth every pennyEcosystem and OS : Android OS is not as polished as iOS even in its current Jelly bean format . However it is more fluid than ICS. As to apps there are quite a few now in play store that are designed for tablets. Luckily for me all the apps i use i found them in play store . Also android is more open . So it allows me to manage my files the way i want and also root the device if i choose to. It is open to other ecosystems like Amazon market place so i am not tied down to a single ecosystem. This is huge benefit as i was tired of Apple restricting everything to iTunesCameras: I will use them only for skype so no issue with the ones on the tablet. Will never use the back camera for taking pics so it doesn't matter to me what quality pics it takes. however what ever pics i took for testing were decentThings i didn't like : The backbutton and multitask button are so sensitive that when watching movies i have accidentally swiped them and it went back to home page. there is no easy way to disable this . Also not a fan of the location of power button or vol rocker. However the samsung galaxy book cover case is alleviating this a bit ..Overall it is a very solid tablet filled with ton of features and at reasonable price(IMO) on a very flexible and open ecosystem . You just can't beat that. Also it is way better than iPad mini (IMO)..\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I am a Samsung lover; purchased Omnia, Galaxy S, S2, Tab 7, Note 2, Galaxy note 10.1 and Galaxy 8.0. I purchased this device  on August 15 and used for 3 weeks now. There is one thing that I want to inform you before you purchase this device.If you want to purchase this device, DO NOT update your firmware until Samsung releases firmware update 4.2.2, meaning use As-Is for now.Firmware issue!After the purchase, there were at least 3 firmware updates from Samsung and the latest firmware came with touchscreen freeze function which made this tablet pause for 3 ~ 5 seconds. Yes, touch response literally freezes. So I contacted Samsung tech support and they recommended hard reset of the device. I went to XDA Developer website and found there were so many others who experienced the same as I did and do. Worst part is that Samsung is not aware of this issue.Samsung has been releasing Android 4.2.2 (current version is 4.1.2) which has the fix for this issue, but there is no release date available for Wi-Fi version.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update on 10/7/2013Samsung finally released 4.2.2 and touch screen issue resolved with the update.BUT!!!!! now I notice that internet application closes out when it tries to load flash player on some websites. Samsung should have tested thoroughly. Note 10.1 was great, but it seems like 8.0 will have few more bugs to fix!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update on 11/20/2013I did not notice until recently that you are now able to store some programs on SD card. This was one feature that was blocked until the update on 10/7/2013. What does this do? It frees up your internal storage by moving some of your large size apps to SD card. Do note that note 8.0 only has 16GB space, so this will enable you from running out of your internal memory. Few of the previous galaxy phones had this feature, and now on the note 8.0. I was able to move appox. 3GB data to my 32GB SD card. Note 8.0 vs NEXUS 7? Now you may want to re-think because NEXUS 7 does not support micro SD. However, flash player issue is not still resolved...just to remind you.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'If what you need is a device for watching movies or TV shows on, carry around in your coat pocket, in a purse, or small backpack, this is not the device for you. If that\\'s your intention behind buying a small tablet, then there are better options for the price- much better bang for your buck if you must. This includes the Nexus and the slightly more expensive than the nexus but cheaper than this device Apple Ipad Mini (sorry that was a mouthful). However, if you like to or need to take notes and work in a setting where you are constantly on the move, need information quickly, have to organize information well, and increase your overall productivity - then this is the ONLY device I would personally recommend.As someone who is in the medical field, this device gives me the ability to take patient history notes in an organized and secure manner. While there are other great note taking programs out there, the game changer for me personally was the S-Note program with its hand/wrist discrimination feature and hand to text mode. My handwriting is absolutely terrible but it does a phenomenal job of text recognition.  You cannot do this on the iPad and other android devices. In the past, I even invested in a wrist discriminating sensor thing for the iPad and that was a HORRIBLE idea. Not only can and did damage my iPad screen, it also did terrible job writing where I was actually writing. The text was always distorted above the pen contact point.Additionally,  with this device, I was able to make a pdf template on my computer, import it into the SNote software and now use it to take patient history in a consistently organized manner. I never miss those frequently missed questions (like smoking, and packs a day, etc.). Some people have asked me why the the 8 over the 10, and the answer for me is very simple: I can\\'t carry around a ten inch tablet in my white coat, it\\'s just too big. The note fits perfectly in the inside and outside white coat pockets for men\\'s sizes (>36), it sticks out a tiny bit in the smaller sizes (<32). My one recommendation, however, is to get a cover because you don\\'t want to scratch your screen against your equipment or vice versa.As a student, I can use this to annotate lecture notes and Powerpoints very easily. While the software can\\'t import Power-point files, it\\'s very easy to convert them into a PDF, especially on Office 2007 and then send it to yourself or load it onto the Dropbox. I can then import the pdf into Snote and note away.As far as storage goes, these files aren\\'t very big but if you are planning on using more storage (movie\\'s etc.), then invest in an expandable memory. It\\'s one of the big advantages of this device over the Ipad mini.Yes it has a hefty price tag but the features are un-paralleled for productivity. However, the way I see it: you pay 300 for the premium specifications on the device, like the graphic card and processor, and another 100 for the S-pen feature. For me, it\\'s an investment worth making if you are using it for the right reasons.Battery Life: Great but depending on the frequency of use, might require charging.Feel: I have big hands so it fit\\'s pretty easily. It feels like holding note pad. If you have small hands and want to use this in a manner similar to what I do, try it at Best Buy first because I can see this being a problem for people with smaller hands. By try it, I mean really try it, pick it up and write on it for a few minutes.Note taking tip: The only tip I can give so far is that if you are taking notes and are getting frustrated by your wrist hitting the buttons (menu + back), flip it 180 with the camera on the bottom and the buttons on top. Works like a charm for me.If you have other questions, please feel free to ask. I will try to help in whatever way possible.Update:Importing tip: So this isn\\'t the most intuitive of things for previous ipad/iphone users but to import files or even just bring up a menu while in a program, click on the button to the right of the \"home button\" (the one that lights up and looks like the top of a college ruled paper). I know this seems like a stupid tip but believe me - when I was first trying to figure out how to \"import\" things into S-note or find how to reach the table of contents in the Kindle App, I almost lost it.S-pen compatibility: First thing, if you buy a new stylus, make sure you undock the previous stylus before using the new one. The new stylus will not work if you leave the old one in. Secondly, http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Holder/dp/B0076Z3GMG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1367301937&sr;=8-4&keywords;=S-Pen+Samsung+Galaxy+Note, that stylus feels nice but the one that I bought is slightly off calibration and the text is a few mm off. If this isn\\'t a big deal then go for it. However, if you are OCD, this can be really frustrating.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'When I started looking for an ideal tablet a month ago, I was sure that I was going to get the iPad mini. Then I started doing some research and found galaxy note 8.0. It was selling for the same price of $329 at staples, so it was all about the features. The reasons why I finally chose galaxy 8.0 were:1. Micro SD slot - This is a big one for me. I can dump all my music and quite a few movies on the card. I can also transfer photos from my SLR onto this and use it almost as a storage device.2. Higher resolution, 2 GB RAM and quad-core processor - The resolution, though better than the iPad mini, won\\'t knock your socks off. However, I was pleasently suprised by how nice and vibrant the colors look on this tablet. Also, I think this is the only tablet that offers you 3 different display options: Dynamic, Movie and Standard. The quad core 1.6 GHz processor really shines while playing graphic intensive games.3. Android ecosystem - This is more of a personal preference. I replaced my iPhone with an SG3 last year and I found the google ecosystem to be much more open. There\\'s definitely a downside to this, but I like the fact that I don\\'t have to buy adapters every time I want to connect my phone or tablet with an accessory. It all just works, and it is only getting better with time.4. S-pen - For a student, this really helps. It completely replaces pen and paper. Also, the tablet comes pre-loaded with polaris office, which can be used to view and edit word and excel documents or view power point presentations. It is really nice and easy to use.5. Potability/8 inch screen - This is again a personal preference, but I think 8 inch is the perfect size for a tablet. Not too small, not too big. It is just the right size to carry when you\\'re on the go. It is lightweight and convenient to hold in one hand.6. IR Blaster - Hardly a must have feature, but it\\'ll be intereseting to see how well this works with my Samsung TV.7. Playstore credit - You get $25 google playstore credit to purchase apps, music or movies when you register the product on samsung website. You also get 3 free months of Hulu, free boingo internet for a year as well as $50 credit towards watch on (I have not used it yet, but when I do I\\'ll come back and update this review).8. GPS - Even though this is a WiFi only tablet, I can install applications such as CoPilot and download maps for navigation offline. It only costs $9.99 and you can try it for 2 full weeks before buying. I was going to purchase a new GPS separately, but not anymore.One thing to note before you buy this tablet is the battery life. It is not stellar. It is in fact just okay. But there are things one can do to increase the battery life, especially when the tablet is in sleep mode:1. Install juice defender from playstore. Mine is always in \"agressive\" mode. This really helps extending the stand by time.2. Make sure WiFi is off during sleep mode.3. I get notifications (email, facebooks etc.) on my smartphone. So, there\\'s really no need for me to get those same notifications on my tablet. I also have automatic sync turned off. I sync manually when I open an application.4. GPS and bluetooth are on only when I need them.5. I use cleanup master and I have the automatic background task kill switched on. I also regularly clean up the background tasks.6. I keep the brightness at about 25-35%. It is enough when you\\'re indoors, and it is easy on the eyes. When I am outside, I turn the auto brightness on. I also have the power saving mode on most of the times.7. I use avast anti-virus on this tablet as well as on my phone. I don\\'t know how much it helps with the battery but it definitely helps guard against unwanted virses, malware and spyware.If you do just this, you should notice a significant increate in battery life. With moderate use, I am able to go through 2 full days before it needs recharging. However, if you\\'re browsing the Internet or playing youtube clips constantly, don\\'t expect the battery to last more than 7-8 hours.I have no problem recharging the tablet every 2 days. However, if you\\'re on the go all the time and need the tablet to last more, I\\'d suggest buying a separate 9000 mAh battery. It is portable and it gives you 2 full recharges. It is not an ideal solution, but atleast you know that just for $50 more, you can go without plugging in your tablet for almost an entire week.In the end, I think the reason why there are so many tablets out in the market is because no one tablet is ideal for everybody. Every tablet has it\\'s adantages and disadvantages. The tablet that you buy depends on how you\\'re going to use it and what you\\'re going to use it for.Hope this helps.Update: Some people have been asking about the storage space available for apps on this tablet. You get close to 9.5 gb for applications. Music, movies, pictures and other documents can be stored on a sd card.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This is my personal review as a female, middle-aged, not-so-tech-savvy user.  The new Note 8.0 is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1 that I have been using at work and love.  That was why, even with the price, I chose to buy this the minute it was released.  I also own an ipad 3 and a kindle Fire HD so i have experience with all of them.  The size of this was a big bonus as it it much easier for dropping in my purse and hitting the road.  I chose this over the iPad mini because of the expandable memory and the S Pen.  it was a slam dunk because i also wanted work functions that I don't feel I have with my regular iPad.  This is an entertainment tablet as well as a very functional work tool.  The S Pen is the major draw...and be careful to not lose it because replacements are pricey.I love the ease and function of the S Pen.  And considering the price, I am pleased that it tucks away so neatly and stays securely. I have misplaced it twice, so it is just a matter of time until I have to replace it...however, it doesn't feel as though it will ever just fall out on its own.  I really love it because it feels like using a real pen and the handwriting is actually MY handwriting.  Taking notes or just jotting things down is much easier on this than on my iPad.  It is much clearer and a simpler function.  The pen feels much more natural too.  I have that rubber-nub ended pen for the iPad and the S Pen BY FAR is superior.It is slightly larger, obviously than my Kindle Fire HD 7...but that inch makes a huge difference when reading and watching videos.  It doesn't feel any more cumbersome than the Kindle.  They are both very sturdy and feel well built.  My son will now inherit the Kindle HD as this is replacing it.  The Note fulfills ALMOST all of the entertainment functions of the Kindle with obviously greater functions for work.  The main function I will miss on the Kindle is the Prime Video streaming app from Amazon.  Amazon has made the app available to iPad and the Kindles, but no other Android device. ***update*** a helpful soul directed me to download xScope from Google Play and the flash player in that browser works GREAT with Amazon videos.  Be sure to set your security to allow apps from other sources, at least during the first run with the browser because it sets up flash from the Adobe site directly.The expandable memory is a big deal for me and I immediately put in a 64gb  memory card.  Samsung warns that a 64 gb memory card may cause instability and that 32 is the biggest recommended.  I've experienced no instability yet and will update if I do.  I store and play a lot of music and videos with my Note.  The internal speaker is acceptable, but not awesome.  The sound on the Kindle is much higher quality as far as the internal speaker is concerned.  The headphone jack is loud and clear.  I hook into my car speakers and use this as a video device, GPS, and music player.  I also use it for audiobooks with the audible app.  That app is slightly different than the iPad version, but equally as functional and kind of more sleek in how it operates.The screen is crystal clear and beautiful.  (The S pen is a bonus here too as well. Fewer fingerprints). Watching videos and taking pictures is a pleasure..  The camera takes great pictures.  The camera is comparable to the Kindle HD7, but not to the IPad.  Front and rear facing cameras...the one in the back seems to take better still shots.  I guess the screen isn't as great as my iPad, but I have to admit that I can't tell the difference.  That may be because this screen is so small or because my eyes are 43 years old and nothing looks all that clear anymore.Kindle and ebook reader app differences:  I didn't notice this at first, but someone asked about it so I checked.  There is a significant difference in the appearance of reading ebooks between this and the Note 10.1.  This is much softer looking, like real paper.  it seems to be much easier on the eyes and I believe will make a significant difference in how tired my eyes feel after reading for any extended period.  It is a nice improvement!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"After almost 4 weeks worth of use:I will not comment more on anything else I have written about below, suffice to say that battery life while excellent is still about 70% of what the iPad mini provides(I still get about 8 hours of continuous use and 16 hours of standby on average each day.) Beyond that, in all other aspects, this has been a superior device(for me at least) than the Mini, which I still carry around as a backup(mainly for tv shows,movies and when battery is low on the Note). Why? essentially because the screen resolution, reminders and use of widgets far outclasses the ipad mini. Seriously, if you currently have any kind of Android Smart Phone and are familiar with the quirks*, buy the Note 8. If you have an iPhone and do not care about widgets and getting reminders/notifications that repeat, can be autosnoozed and that you can actually hear...then stick with the Mini.*Quirks: The Note 8 and any Android device can have battery drain while on Standby if you do not tweak your settings and/or have poorly written apps downloaded. My advice is to steer clear of free apps sponsored by ads, since that is a major culprit: buy the paid versions or do not download. As to tweaking Android settings, there are many pages you can Google depending on the version of Android you have, but this is a useful site:[...] Size compared to Nexus 7: I am hearing Ad Nauseum about how much better the Nexus 7 is for the price. Well that is not valid, in my opinion, if only because the size of the two tablets is so different. Yes really: even though the specs say only one inch difference, there is a huge difference in viewing and clarity: the Note 8(like the iPad Mini) is the perfect balance between a 7 inch tablet which is too small to be useful for productivity, and a 10 inch tablet which is too bulky and heavy. Comparisons in price should take this into account, as well as the stylus,lack of SD card support on Nexus 7 and the superior battery life(especially during standby) of the Note 8. Comparing the Nexus to the Note is like comparing apples to iguanas- a slight exaggeration perhaps, but you get the point. Go into Best Buy to compare: the Note looks about 30% bigger compared to the Nexus...It isn't, but that is how much more comfortable it feels.Update 8 on day 7: BATTERY LIFE- One comment I received was that someone was having only 3-4 hours battery life just using the S-Pen and no other app. While S-pen is a battery hog, that should still not be the case. I have to specify that I only have my brightness settings set to 35-40%(more than adequate even for video) and only turn on my GPS if I need it for directions(I get at least 9 hours of continual use). These two settings alone can easily double your battery life and is something I have automatically done on all my tablets for several years. Also, I have only the sound notifications I need turned on-for example I do not need Facebook, Ultimate TODO etc and other notifications, since my S3 smartphone handles those.Again, this makes a significant difference to battery life. Finally-the first day I received the Note I used it down to less than 5% and then fully charges overnight. Despite any other advice you may hear, I have always found a memory issue in batteries which is avoided by running down the battery as soon as you receive a device and fully charging it,then doing the same thing every few weeks. Battery life is always going to be subjective from person to person due to the difference in usage-but screen brightness,gps and notification settings are key factors for any user in preserving battery life on a mobile device.Update 7 on day 6: One negative I do have is the amount of bloatware on the device 16GB became 9.8GB. Fine if you had 32GB to start off with...but since the only current model is 16GB that sucks. Anyway, the good news is that even having downloaded 50 apps and hundreds of pics, several smaller event videos and dozens of books, I still have 7.8GB left. Does limit number of movies I can watch from Google Play-DRM Issue with not being able to move these to SD Card. I could root but in the past that has caused instability(especially after system updates), so I do not do that anymore.I would be tempted to deduct half a star for the bloatware(Google magazines. Allshare etc) but some people do actually use these. But they should just make them removable instead of system integrated. Titanium backup can help you remove these, but again I do not really want to Root, but I knew this going in and did not want to wait for a 32GB model. 90% of the time I do not need more than one or 2 movies on my device, so I can live with that.Oh, I almost forgot, the Samsung keyboard has a feature you may not have noticed, but let me back up a bit. My favorite keyboard ever is SwiftKey(on my Galaxy 3), but I do not need it on this device, since the built in keyboard does the same thing for predictions and learning etc(IMHO). But also, if you need to go back on what you have written to edit,you can just run your finger/stylus across the keyboard to scroll backwards or forwards, up or down till you get to the area you wish to edit. Much simpler and faster than trying to pinpoint with the end of your finger/stylus. i discovered this by accident, even though it is in a user guide somewhere I later discovered.Update 6 on Day 5: The latest thing I have noticed, but did not mention yet, is the Smart Stay feature(under Display settings, default set to on). It ensures that the screen never shuts off while you are looking at it: so even if you have a 30 second screen timeout to save battery power(for when you glance quickly and then forget to turn off screen), you can read uninterrupted. It actually makes most sense to have a screen timeout of 1 minute for me I have found.Also, if there is a large amount of text on the screen, and you have a one minute timeout, the smart stay feature is phenomenal. I had not commented on this before, because i already use my Samsung S3 and so take this feature for granted. Turning this off is a mistake, since, trust me, you will use more power turning your screen on each time it times out otherwise.Today I received over 80 emails, read them and dozens of weather alerts and emergency alarms due to flooding around here. This is about 4 times more in notifications than usual, but no discernible increase in battery usage over the normal usage I have mentioned below. I am going to do some intensive video watching over the next couple of days and post the results on battery life.Update 5 on Day 4: With the Quad Core processor on this, it puts the Nexus 7 to shame. I can multitask at least 9 different apps with no noticeable lag or significant power drain. I read another review say that they drained 30% of the battery after reading 10% of a book. I read 30% of a book(150 real pages on Kindle app in 2 hours) with only 10% drain. So it is not so much how many pages you read but the amount of time it takes you to read, and the brightness setting. Don't get me wrong, the IPad mini(only one you should compare to due to size of screen)has significantly better battery life, but the Note is up there with the best of the Android tablets, and I will certainly trade some battery power against getting customization and widgets.Update 4 on Day 4: I installed 7 more apps today-New York Times,Ultimate To-do,Slice, Ap-memo, Data Vault and a few others. They were all optimized for tablets, as compared to even a year ago when that was most definitely not the case. With better resolution tablets and Samsung increasing their tablet market closer and closer to 50%, developers are churning out tablet optimized apps like crazy. This will solve the only real issue I see with this tablet. Then Samsung should bring out an amoled screen version of this device and with a higher resolution-something like 1900 x 1200. Even though that will not be as high as the future retina display iPad mini- the difference will not be noticeable. A combination of a more user customizable operating system,more tablet apps and better resolution, will(IMHO) mean the iPad Mini, even with a retina display, will get a run for the money. Also, I would stress again, that if you are going to browse the web a lot-definitely pick this(with Firefox) over the iPad Mini. Why use a device that does not allow you to increase font size and be able to fit that to the screen? i hate that about Apple mobile products0THeir OS does not currently work with Textflow software.Update 3 on Day 4: Battery life continues to be excellent. I have discovered that the S-Pen has an incredible utility, even if you are not a student. By pressing and holding on the microphone symbol next to the space bar on the Samsung Keyboard, you get a box pop up with several icons: Clicking the one with a capital T and and a pen on it, changes the input method in any App so that you have a scratchpad at the bottom to hand write. This is then converted into text. For longer emails or blogging, this is very useful. I also used it for shorter Facebook comments and jotting down smaller notes. My handwriting is not the best, but with a little practice I was able to be 80% accurate on the longer notes and pretty much spot on for the one or two line notations. I may not draw or take long lecture notes, but the S-Pen now had substantially higher value than originally thought. Also, it hands down beats a regular stylus for responsiveness, scrolling and smoothness. It literally is an extension of your finger, but with a much higher degree of accuracy and precision.Update 2: This is really just to warn anyone reading the first review (most helpful one listed), that there is a comment there in the middle of the review, that says the Note is really fast to charge-in 1 hour. That is not my experience and I cannot see how that would be possible, unless the tablet is at 80% or something already or maybe if there are no apps apart from what are preloaded(though i cannot see that either)- which admittedly may be what the reviewer meant. However I didn't read it that way and I think others might not either. I got the charge down to 5%-at which stage certain protection protocols are built in(cannot be altered that I could find), so the screen remained dim. It took 3 hours with the unit fully shutdown to charge back to 100%. Just an FYI to anyone thinking that there is an amazing 1 hour charge time. Hope this helps.Update 1: After 2 solid days of continual use I can say that the battery life is excellent in standby and while in use. It loses less than 1% per hour on standby. This is with WiFi AND GPS continually running, and updates for weather,email and other PIM apps running in the background.I get 15 hours of use per day with 7 hours on standby and 8 used continually for web surfing, reading, app store and downloading apps.Resolution is wonderful-screen angles superb at any angle. Better looking graphics than iPad Mini. nexus 7 and even pretty close to Kindle HD-despite the Kindle having much higher specs for resolution on paper at least. Samsung just make the best screens. I would,as other users have commented, not use this Note for intensive gaming, but RPG games run superbly and Google Play video looks just as good as anything the Kindle HD 8.9 can provide-again, specs are not everything, Samsung havedesigned their screems to maximize appearance and richness of video. Battery life when playing movies is great(compared to other Android tablets),I was able to watch 3 movies lasting 5 hours and still be on 60% battery. But i will test more, since in my previous experience, battery life runs down much faster when you get below 50%- a quirk of the Android operating system. This is an area where Apple still dominate with superior battery life. more to follow in the days ahead.Original review:FYI I got my device from Best Buy(barely 2 days ago) and since I am a Premier Silver member, I get 60 days to return.If you already use a Samsung S3, then this will be the perfect accompaniment: a very sleek, fast and eye-catching device-get Samsung's own smart cover for this since it is the best available currently at Best Buy(in white at my store) if you want the slimmest,lightest case that does not cover the bezel(my preference only).I essentially got this to be able to read my blogs and news articles, surf the web, track calender,reminders, to do lists. I can do this on the S3, but this way I get to save my eyesight a lot more: which suddenly has become an issue in my mid forties!! I also have an iPad mini which I love-but on any iPad device there is an issue of hearing the alarms, customizing sounds and changing snoozes, auto snoozing and generally having nagging reminders. There are some Apple apps that can help but not many to choose from. Android does not have that issue because of the open source operating system. So I use the iPad mini for portability,surfing reading,email,video facebook and games, and my S3 smart phone for all the reminders and tasks etc-they still sync onto my iPad mini, but I hear the alarms and get the nagging reminders on my phone. The Galaxy Note 8 now lets me have the reminders,surf the web with a better Firefox browser that has text reflow for virtually ANY site, shop, read and take a few handwritten notes excellently(Facebook app is awful on Android-Feria on Ipad Mini is a dream). Unlike other reviewers, the S-Pen is only useful in a minor way for me, since I am not at college or studying. All the other benefits listed above make this worth it for me on their own. One of the best things is the use of the Firefox app-being able to turn almost any page into easily read text format only, with adjustable font,is priceless when so much time is spent on the Web. As is the ease of which you can zoom in on any page, and the text will reflow to the larger font and fit the screen(also syncing my Desktop web Bookmarks and history): Essential, but something no decent browser on Apple devices can successfully accomplish-so on my Apple devices I tend to use Flipboard, Taptu, Zite and other RSS readers to fulfill the News functions.The reason I am deducting one star is threefold: The price should be $350 to match the iPad Mini(the only real competitor to this product IMHO); There are not that many Android Apps truly optimized for Android tablets-unlike Apple and the S-Pen still does not have its incredible usefulness shown because there are only a handful of apps written for it. I deduct only 1 star for all 3, since the S-Pen is NOT the main reason I got this Tablet and with software updates/more apps on the way, I know this will change-so i deducted only a quarter star for this, a quarter star for the price, but half a star for Android not having more Tablet Optimized apps. Gaming is something I do rarely,but I find the Ipad mini/ my S3 to be excellent for that, since the battery life is phenomenal on the Mini especially. I will write more about battery life on the Note, watching movies etc when I have used it a few more days. I certainly am glad that I purchased at this moment however and hope this helps everyone who is considering, but confused by so many tablets out there right now.If this has been helpful or not please vote accordingly. I usually answer any comments within a day or so when testing out tablets-which is something I do as a partially paid amateur hobby.I have owned or tested virtually all Tablets released in North America over the last 4 years.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I was the first in line in my local store and got one. The weight is ideal. It feels very nice to hold and work on it. It is definitely expensive than its counterparts, but having a well integrated stylus makes it an excellent buy. I was able to run many apps/games/navigation/music/youtube videos. Fast and smooth. I have verified using a 32 GB SD card and basically carry all of your music. The total storage is effectively 48 GB. (I have a 50 G box and other cloud accounts, so I don\\'t store movies/songs on this).  Also Google Music works great on this, I have close to 10,000 songs on google music. The playback and speaker quality is ok, I expected a better speaker for its size.  1.6GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM makes applications butter smooth. I for someone like the plastic finish and I think this is great for what it does. Lightweight, no scratch and looks awesome on this device. Lot of press criticizes Samsung for its plastic, but who cares. Customers seems to love this design. I also confirmed this Note 8.0 takes 64 GB microSD card.I use Google KEEP for note taking on Galaxy Note 8.0 and it is awesome. I like everything on Google ecosystem as it is seamless. Keep is in early stages and I am sure google will update to keep it modern. Note taking is one of the string points of this tablet and there are several apps out there. Keep, OneNote, Samsung\\'s own apps and lot of third party apps. Keep debuted only in 2013 and is simple and powerful!Pen is awesome and it is almost like holding a traditional notepad for notetaking. Kids will love hundreds of sketching apps. This has S-GPS as opposed to A-GPS, but gets GPS locks easily. My NAVIGON is great for in car navigation. Now to get a mount! Obviously I need to mount lower and not at dashboard level. Big maps, nice navigation. Google Navigation will _NOT_ work without a mifi or some sort of mobile connectivity. You can use Freedom Spot Photon 4G Mobile Hotspot (Black) which I am using while on car. Freedompop uses Clearwire technology and has great coverage where I live. You get 500 GB free each month!Some complaints* I am highly disappointed Samsung dropped 4G and mobile connectivity in the US. Having a phone functionality is a big plus. Even though it is weird to hold against your head, speakerphone/bluetooth are excellent options. I really dislike carrying multiple devices.* WatchON is basically useless for me, as I have an older TV. Samsung is trying to get you into their ecosystem* Expensive, its competitor Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB) or even Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) are far cheaper. If you are not into latest, you can take a step back. My recommendation will be for ASUS Fonepad which is a 7\" and has a phone functionality built in. It may sound weird, but integrated devices are all the rage.* Would have preferred a better camera.I am giving a 4 star mainly because of the price, If it is $300, would get a 5 stars! I am sure price will drop steeply once demand increases. I will upgrade to 5 stars once price drops!Some of the apps I have tried  on this tablet so far are :- Amazon Kindle, aLogcat, Asphalt 7, Battery Monitor Widget Pro (shows accurate measurements), Car Reminder Maintenance Pro, Chrome, DragonVale, Draw Something, Google Drive, eBay, facebook, Flashlight (very handy), Flipboard, Keep (though Samsung note app is great), Samsung Apps, LastPass, Merriam Webster dictionary, Navigon, Google Nav using MiFi, PAC-MAN (!!), Pogoplug (gives me Terabytes on the go on wifi from my home private cloud), RealCalc (great calculator program), Nike Running+ (great visualization), Subsonic, Skype, SwitchPro widget, Taptalk HD (awesome app), Tweetcaster pro, Twit.TV, Withings (weight watcher app), Youtube, Terminal Emulator.Ask me questions and I will answer within a day or if you want me to try some apps on this tablet. I like answering questions/comments here from users...',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Let me begin by saying that I typically do not purchase any types of technology at launch.  I made the exception in this case, because I believe in the ultimate usefulness of this product by Samsung.  I have owned many apple products and for a time, I did enjoy them.  However, I always grew tired of apple tablets and smartphones because I realized that they usually only work well with other apple products.  Furthermore, every iteration of smartphone or tablet was only incrementally improved upon by the company.  Apple makes very nice but linear products.  They offer a very streamlined approach to technology at all levels across their product line.  They are great, if you only wish to do very simplistic task; such as surf the internet, buy content from Itunes and apps via the app store. Ipads are great at content consumption but are equally as cumbersome to use as a content creation device.  This is truly where the note 8 shines.  It's a great bridge device between your smartphone and your laptop.  The S pen is what makes this tablet a winner.Before any are quick to state that the Note 8 is overpriced relative to the Ipad mini or even the regular sized Ipad I ask you to consider the following:  The Ipad mini is quite literally built with the same internals as the two year old Ipad 2, which still sells at $399. The mini costs apple $115 to make and they sell it old components and all to consumers for the price of $329.  They are making a killing selling the same thing in a smaller package.  Is Samsung doing the Same with the Note 8 relative to the Note 10,1?  In my opinion, no.  The Note 8 is an improvement from the standpoint of a faster processor, better software integration with the S pen and what I feel is better build quality and increased durability.  The note 8 is a refined and improved version of the note 10.1.  The 8 has added greater functionality over the 10.1. these improvements to both hardware and software justify the price.  After all, the same individuals screaming about how costly this device is are the same ones that are willing to buy a mini which is only $70 cheaper than the dated and yet bigger ipad 2.  the tech which powers both the larger note  10.1, and now the 8 came roughly 8 months apart.  In short, this means that the cost of these components has not depreciated to levels which one could consider significant, when one considers the cost of manufacturing both iterations of this deviceThe apps argument is largely a creation of tremendous marketing skill on the part of apple.  There are few apps which cannot be found on both platforms and for those few I have always been successful at finding a suitable substitute.  I have found that a few android apps may lack some of the features of their ios equivalents...but these instances are dwindling inn number.  The same can be said of the app optimization argument.  Apple does a great job of creating apps specifically tailored to both the phone and tablet space but android is making strides to do the same.  I am willing to sacrifice the aesthetics offered by apple for the functionality offered by Samsung and android; specifically the note 8.Finally, an additional point is worth the mention.  I always find it funny when people are so obsessed with bashing screen resolution.  this is an 8 inch screen and quite clear and beautiful.  It is not a 50 inch LCD.  How many pixels can you cram into any tablet screen, before it becomes pointless and frankly entirely ridiculous?  Yes, there are tablets that are cheaper with better resolution but these do not employ the use of a fully functional stylus.  My point here is that i'm certain that higher screen resolution would have certainly come at the expense of greater S pen integration, software and functionality. These are the primary selling points of this tablet.  The galaxy note 8 is the best production tablet on the market at any size.  Its feature set alone makes it a must have for either a student or business professional such as myself.  I hope this helps those of you on the fence about purchasing the tablet.  For me cost and expense are relative terms. Yes, for $400 you could buy a full sized Ipad. But at that size, ask yourself how much will you use the device?  Will you get your money's worth?  I for one would consider this money well spent because I will actually use this device quite heavily making it worth the cost.  This is something I could never say about any Ipad I've ever owned.  Hope this has helped.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I recently purchased this tablet at my local BestBuy to check it out for a few days and then returned it and bought it on Amazon (no sales tax)after realizing that it is definitely the best tablet I\\'ve ever used.  This thing packs a punch for many different reasons....here\\'s why:Packaging:  Easily beats Apple in the packaging of this product.  It comes in a sleek and stylish \"wood\" type box.  The first thing you see when you open it is the tablet itself with a nice screen protector on it (that you have to peel off).  Below the tablet is the charger and USB cable along with a getting started guide.First boot:  The tablet boots right up at about 75-80% battery life.  It is your usual Android experience:  login with your Google account and Samsung account (can use the same credentials) and all of your contacts, apps, settings, etc. are synced to the device.  If you don\\'t have either of these accounts or if it is your first time with an Android device, you can register and get started within minutes.  A very simple setup experience.  Once you get into the device itself, Samsung has integrated some tutorials and tips into TouchWiz to help you get familiar with the interface.S-pen:  Okay, let\\'s be honest.  You should (and most probably do)buy this device for the S-pen alone.  This thing is awesome and is miles ahead of any other stylus out there.  Samsung has done a fantastic job.  The handwriting to text works flawlessly (even with my mediocre handwriting).  S-note is pretty great, but the pen works with most other note-taking apps I have tried as well (OneNote, Evernote, etc).  There are lots of magical things you can do with this pen as well, just search for things like \"S-pen smart hover\", or \"S-pen shortcuts\".Screen:  The screen packs a ppi of 189 at 1280x800.  For an 8-inch tablet this is great.  I have tried 10 inch and 7 inch tabs, and I think I have found the sweet spot at 8 inches.  It\\'s the perfect size for portability while not sacrificing real-estate.  When this is held up to the Nexus 7 it\\'s a pretty noticeable difference in screen size.  I can hold this in portrait mode with one hand easily, and landscape with two without my arms getting tired.  For those debating between 10, 7, and 8 inch screens.....go with the 8.  I\\'ve owned all sizes and can say this is my favorite so far.Speakers:  Nobody buys a tablet for the amazing speakers that they have.  That\\'s just not what they are for.  I can\\'t complain about the speakers on the Note 8 though, they get the job done.  My wife was watching a trailer on my tablet in another part of the house and I could hear it crystal clear.  Good enough speakers for what they are meant to do.Form factor:  I bought the black, 16gb version.  The black on brown looks super sexy and feels great in my hand.  I honestly love the feel of the tablet.  Some people say \"oh it\\'s plastic and not as sleek as the iPad metal\".  Well, plastic doesn\\'t scratch as easy and is lighter.  Plus, you can take the back off of the tablet and access whatever you need.  Most people will be using a case anyway, so let\\'s face it....who cares about what the back is made out of.Battery:  Wow.  Battery life is amazing on this thing.  I went 2 days on the first charge (at 75%).  Everyone knows that the first couple of days you buy something new you use it more than you normally will....well that\\'s the case with me and I still got a good 48 hours out of a 75% charge.  I left the tab at 50% the first night, woke up 8 hours later and it\\'s at 48%.  I can live with that.  Of course if you are doing heavy 3-D gaming it will eat the battery a little more, but for normal productivity and social tasks, this battery is a trooper.Camera:  You are using your tablet for it\\'s camera capabilities? That\\'s weird....don\\'t do that.  It\\'s nice to have a front facing camera for skype and the likes, but who really cares about the rear facing camera and it\\'s capabilities.Storage:  Having an external SD card slot is nice....but having it accessible without having to take off the case is even nicer.  Am I right?!  I have a 64gb SD card in this thing, bringing my total storage capacity to 80gb.OS:  Android is miles ahead of iOS right now...just look at the market share.  If you are debating between investing in the iOS or Android ecosystem....trust me (a former heavy iOS user)and go with Android.  If you are sick of seeing release after release after release and nothing changing in iOS then switch to Android.Misc. perks:  I can use this as a remote control for my TV....that is awesome.  When you purchase this and register with Samsung you get $25 to the Google Play store (as of 8/12/2013).  You also get 50gb to Dropbox free for 2 years, $50 to the Samsung movie store thing, and 3 free months of Hulu Plus.  When you put that into account, the price doesn\\'t seem so bad.That being said, the price is the ONLY thing I don\\'t absolutely love about this tablet.  I got it for $379.00 on sale through Amazon, so it\\'s definitely on the higher end of the <10 inch tablets.  However, it\\'s definitely (IMHO) the best of the best in it\\'s market.Android + Samsung Note 8 = win.  Go ahead and enjoy this tablet, I sure am.',\n",

It is the perfect size, I can upload all my notes with audio to Dropbox, my email or any cloud service I like.  The S pen is amazing, It feels even better than writing on paper.  I have used it to watch videos/TV shows, and for general everyday stuff.  I don't have to carry notebooks to classes anymore, it's really amazing and easy to use.  I bought this tablet FALL13 after doing a long research of many tablets available in the market.  I'm so happy, you cant regret if you plan on taking notes in this tablet.  If you like a bigger size the galaxy note 10 version 2014 looks amazing with super HD display.PROS:portabilityNote taking for collegeno notebooksno books(if u use e-books, I still prefer books)Super fastMultitaskingSend notes to dropboxCONS:haven't found any one yetIf you have any questions just ask me.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This Note 8 is the perfect size tablet for me. I tried out the Kindle Fire 8.9, but because of the thick border around the screen it makes the device a little bit too big to fit comfortably in my hand.  I felt like it was piveting in my hand.  The Note 8 fits nicely in my handbag and it fits comfortably in one hand.  A 7 inch tablet is a bit too small, but this 8 inch is perfect.  I'm really glad I bought it and it was worth the extra cash.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I commute to university on public transit and I used to take my heavy laptop to school every day because I thought it was the best method for typing notes and accessing eTextbooks. I started looking at tablets because I was tired of lugging around that heavy computer all the time. I was looking in the 7 inch range for one-handed use but I decided that there was no way an on screen keyboard could keep up with taking lecture notes.Someone on reddit\\'s Android subreddit introduced me to the Note 8 and I was immediately hooked on the idea of handwritten notes on a tablet. After trying it out in a local electronics store (where they were asking $399) I knew that this was the tablet to replace my laptop. The S-Pen doesn\\'t track instantaneously, but it\\'s fast enough to feel natural when writing and drawing. My only gripe with S-Pen is that the button on the stylus is a bit hard to press, but that\\'s the nitpickiest nitpick there is.I\\'m not totally in love with TouchWiz, Samsung\\'s \"skin\" that they place over Android to include their own looks and features. My phone runs mostly stock Android and has done so for years so I suppose it\\'s merely a matter of preference so I don\\'t dock it any points. It\\'s not bad, just not the flavor of Android I like best. Fortunately the S-Pen works fine with third party ROMs.The screen is sharp despite the relatively low ppi (pixels per inch, 189ppi) and is great for reading. The colors are too brightly contrasted or harsh and the tablet has a massive brightness range from very bright to VERY dim--perfect for when the professor turns off the lights and turns on the projector.The hardware specs are great and it runs any game with ease. I\\'ve considered getting a sacrificial TPU case and a Gameklip for big screen mobile gaming with a controller. 1080p movies and videos playback fine though I wouldn\\'t keep 1080p content on the device, total storage hog, plus the tablet is only 720p despite being able to output 1080p to a TV.I purchased an STM folio case to go along with it, something WITHOUT MAGNETS. I\\'ve heard the complaints about magnets damaging the S-Pen functionality and while I don\\'t know if they\\'re definitive, I certainly wouldn\\'t like to find out on my tablet.Overall this is one of the best products I\\'ve ever dropped $340 on. Makes you wonder why a smartphone with less capabilities (except the ability to make phone calls, which incidentally the international Note 8 allows it too) can cost up to twice as much with half the useability. This tablet is someone finally figuring out a mobile device for content creation, not just content consumption.',\n",

This display is bright, the colors are accurate, and operation of various functions are lightning fast. I sold my iPad Mini after purchasing this device. When the Nexus 10 is updated, and a MicroSD slot is added, I will also sell my iPad 3. iPads are also great devices, but they do not offer any user customization at all, nor do they offer MicroSD functionality. Besides, I AM SICK OF APPLE products. Google has hit a home run with the Jellybean operating system. Apple finally has REAL competition in both the phone and tablet space. Great job Google.

       "   u'Content': u'Pros:1. I don\\'t have any complaints about build quality. Even though it is plastic, it feels sturdy.2. It weighs the same amount as my Nexus 7 (1st edition) by feel and according to my digital food scale. It is thinner than Nexus 7.3. I do like the 1 inch bigger screen, it is nicer to read on.4. I like the Memory expansion capability for micro-SD. However, App2SD programs can\\'t move my programs to my memory card. I don\\'t want to root it.5. It has better speed than my Nexus 7.6. I like having more memory and storage so that I don\\'t have to watch my consumption much.7. I like the multi-window feature to look at 2 apps at once.Cons:1. If not using a case, I like the grip feel on the back of the Nexus7. The Note 8.0 is smooth and slick.2. I would like this better if the bezels were thinner, The bezels are about .5 inches length sides, and about .75 on the width sides.3. It goes through battery quicker than Nexus 7. It isn\\'t horrible though. It would be nice to only turn on extra CPU cores when you really need them.4. I miss Android 4.3 like on my Samsung S4. Samsung should send out an update to bring us up from 4.1.2.5. It could use a smaller price point.Other thoughts:1. The screen is the same resolution that the Nexus 7 has, so no big change.2. I\\'m not sure about the pen, it works, but unless you are already a note taker, or doodler, I\\'m not sure it provides me any useful feature.3. I\\'m not sure the differences between Note 8.0 and Galaxy Tab 3 8\" is worth the extra $80. (i\\'ll update as I discover more things)4. Adobe is lame for not supporting Flash on these anymore, but you can still install if you search for Archived Flash Player or visit [...] There are still so many apps out there that support Flash and I haven\\'t seen anything quite take its place yet.If Google still had their 8 or 9 inch tablet that also had micro sd for storage, I would probably lean towards Google.I guess the biggest things to decide on are:What size of a screen do you need?What screen resolution do you want?How much storage do you need?How much RAM do you need?Do you need quad-core or will dual-core suffice?Do you need the S Pen feature?Update 9-14-2013:Battery, While yes it drains faster than the Nexus 7, it is not bad. After optimizing my battery with Battery HD and then 100% charge, it reads:Music Playback  Internet Browsing8h 20m  WiFi: 12h 30mVideo Playback  Talk Tim (VOIP)16h 40m  WiFi: 10h 0 minSo far after having this device for 9 days, I have found good use for it. Here Are some of my favorites:1. Remote Control (like any software you have to find the one that works for you. The Peel Smart Remote that comes with it does not meet my needs, but it controlled my TV, Blu-ray, and Receiver.2. E-mail. My several personal emails, my work email, and my university email, which is the new Office 365 account.3. Church. I can load all my scriptures, hymns and other studying materials.4. Financial. Mint.com to see where my money is going and how much is spent on fast food.5. Inventory. Movies, Posessions, what is needed at the grocery store, etc. (Even with a barcode scanner!)6. Books and magazines including all my geeks stuff that I am interested in.7. Movies and TV shows.8. Communications like facebook and Skype9. Doodling10. Calculators. standard, scientific, graphing, and handyman that understands fractions that a tape measure uses.11. Games. All sorts. For me, for my kids, it seems to be great for this.12. Flashlight for looking for items you lost in the movie theatre after the movie is over or sneaking into your bedroom while your wife is sleeping and trying not to wake her up because you spent all night trying to figure out new and wonderful things to do with your tablet.',\n",

I really prefer the size of the 8 inch screen to the bigger tablet.  For me it is not for work, and the smaller screen is just more convenient.  I was leaning toward the Fire HD when Samsung announced that Note 8 was available.  I immediately did a side by side comparison of the features.  The Kindle screen is just a tad larger, but the Note's thickness  and weight is about half that of the Kindle HD.  Also the notes add on memory was a deal clincher.  I've had this table since it became available and wouldn't think of switching.\",\n",

Yes, but comparing with the competition and similar size, quality, memory and screen, it is in line or above.Reviews suggested insufficient battery life - I disagree, this runs a day in heavy use, after that you need to charge any device. Could be better? Yes, but do you need it?Standard micro-USB for charging, computer connection = GRRREAT finally.Very fast, very sensitive and super screen, stylus is a charm to use.8 Inch size, format of screen seems to fit the sweet spot: light, sufficient size and easy to store or carry (like a standard book size, not a binder).With the right (off line) GPS it navigates smooth and fast.Streaming is spotless, movies on Netflix come very high quality. It plays just about any format video or sound file.Music streaming high quality and with no interruptions.Music playback quality is good (not a Cowon, but not bad for a Samsung).Waiting for Android update, I wish unit came with a newer version or updated by now.However Samsung version of simplified Android screens and added functions is good, easier to use while offering all I need.I was hesitant at first, reading a lot of negative reviews.

       "   u'Content': u\"I LOVE this tablet!  I did a lot of research before purchasing, read just about every review I could find and I don't have the least bit of regret in the choice that I made.  I bought this to replace an iPad 32GB 1st generation that was starting to behave erratically now that the Apple updates were no longer updating its older software.  My old iPad had been a gift from my husband and had sufficed me well enough over the years but the fact that Apple had essentially phased it out of their updates was frustrating and I wanted something with an expandable memory that wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg.My biggest hesitation was over whether to purchase the 8.0 or the newer 10.1 2014 edition.  I'm used to the larger size but the sizable price difference between the 8.0 and the 10.1 really made me question whether I had to have the larger screen.  In the end I decided that I could adapt to the smaller screen and it really hasn't been a problem at all.  I've had my Note for less than a week and I'm already completely comfortable with its size.This thing really blows my old iPad out of the water.  I can't speak to how it compares to the newer ones but there's NO comparison to my old one.  My old iPad was essentially an entertainment device, I could use it to watch movies, read books & surf the web, but it was never a very useful productivity tool.  The S Pen is fantastic, although it did feel a little odd at first simply because I wasn't used to using one.  The handwriting-to-text function is really cool and is remarkably effective at translating your writing.  I've had to correct it on a few things but that's really only been when I've allowed my handwriting to deteriorate into total scribble and I don't have particularly neat handwriting to begin with so I didn't have high hopes for this function but it has impressed me quite a bit.I work remotely so I also wanted to make sure that I could use this as a tool for work.  I'm able to log into Citrix Gateway and access my remote desktop exactly as I do on my computer in my home office. This has been incredibly handy already in the last few days as I've had a terrible cold and spent several days working from my couch.  The S Pen is perfect for this as it's like having a tiny portable mouse for your tablet.  Anyone who's ever connected to a remote desktop on a tablet or phone can attest to the fact that it's REALLY hard to navigate effectively if you're using your finger because everything on the screen is so tiny.  I spent two hours yesterday evening working on updating data in an Excel spreadsheet with over 700 rows in it and didn't run into anything that I can do on my computer that I wasn't able to do from my Note.After registering my Note I received an email confirming my registration but never received an email with the advertised Samsung Perks.  I contacted Samsung Customer Support via Facebook and they gave me an email address to contact and told me what information to include.  I sent an email last night and this morning already had a response with the missing information for how to access the Perks so A+ for Samsung's Customer Service as well.  I really couldn't be more satisfied with this tablet!\",\n",

Amazing tool for any student, I have been waiting years for truly functional tablet + handwriting technology for years and it is finally here. Could not recommend more. Blazing fast, beautiful screen, good construction, excellent included software, good battery, 4.2.2 update does present some minor problems but fixes are available online (multi window function only). Overall the update was good, though. So happy with my purchase. The extra money you pay for having the S pen technology should not be considered a negative because this kind of technology is unique amongst tablets...if you are considering a tablet for school, I would look no further.

       "   u'Content': u\"I purchased one of the brown/black tablets shortly after the release of the new Nexus 7 after looking for a tablet that would be useful for taking notes during meetings at work as well as providing me with a fun, functional tablet.Operating system:The stock operating system of the Note 8.0 is android, and while it is very snappy, it is slightly behind compared to the new Nexus 7 which came with 4.3. The Note 8.0 has some trick functionality built into the Samsung Touchwiz interface, where it automatically loads a list of S-note templates when the s pen is removed from its silo housed on the bottom right of the tablet. Personally, I have used Touchwiz before on my Galaxy S3, but I didn't like the feel. I have upgraded to a different launcher that allows for more customization to all screens. Android is highly adaptable and highly customizable, which is one of my number one reasons for choosing this tablet vs an ipad mini or the new Nexus 7.Feel:The body of the tablet is made of the same plastic and glass as the rest of the Samsung Galaxy flagship line. On a tablet of this size, it doesn't feel bad. The corners are nicely sculpted, the screen is slick and smooth. The S pen is tucked neatly away inside the lower right corner of the tablet, and comes out with a satisfying click when removed. It is nearly a bit too large to handle with one hand, but is large enough that typing is easy, even for someone with large fingers.Screen:The resolution of the screen is 1280x800 and at 189ppi it is quite a bit higher than the current generation ipad mini (163ppi), but significantly lower than the newest Nexus 7 (323ppi). There are some applications that look a bit rough, but the majority of those applications are optimized for phones, rather than tablets. While the Nexus 7 kills this tablet on resolution alone, it doesn't have an s-pen or any of the s-pen specific apps avaiable, so these are really two different animals.Speed:The speed and memory of this tablet are right on par with the rest of the tablets available in the coming months. It is fast, handles multiple processes with ease. I have noticed no slow down issues when watching video and using other apps at the same time.Battery Life:I have been getting several days out of the battery at a shot (depends on my daily usage). However I have wifi set to sleep when the display is off unless it is plugged into an outlet and charging. Usually I am seeing between 6-7hrs of screen on time before getting to about 10% battery. I leave display brightness set to auto, and smart stay is on.S-pen:The s-pen that is included with the device is much larger than those that come with the Note and Note 2 phones. It feels very good in your hand and is definitely usable by people with larger hands (me, being one of them). I still however have chosen to purchase a larger s-pen for comfort reasons when trying to sketch or take notes quickly.I am very happy with the Galaxy Note 8.0 overall. I would have rated it higher if there were more tablet optimized android apps available, a slightly higher screen resolution, and if the price were lower. At this time, the Note 8.0 is really the only android tablet of this size to offer the s-pen, and samsung knows that, so they charge for it. The experience of using the s-pen is in an entirely different world than using a capacitive stylus on any other device.\",\n",

Any worries that this tablet will easily break is just completely wrong.Apps- The note is powerful enough to play any app no problem. They run fast and never lag! I have had iron man 3, fast and furious 6, and Netflix all running at the same time and nothing shut down. On my iPad 3 this would have led to an app crash at the very least.Movies- While I don't usually watch movies on my tablets, the note has no problem playing them. I have Netflix, Hulu, and videos from Google Play on my Note. The note while not quite HD, is still a high quality resolution picture. Images are sharp and crisp on the note with appropriate shading. The ipad does have a slightly higher resolution screen (if that really is all that matters to you in a tablet then get an ipad). The sound quality is okay. The speakers are on the bottom back which I really didn't like, but are easily loud enough to hear without worry.SPen- Is very handy, great for taking notes or memos. It is easier than typing and much faster. the screen is sensitive and easily picks up the pen strokes taking down messages letter for letter without mistake.Browsing the web- incredibly easy to get information and do whatever on the web. Wifi speeds are fast, and has a very strong signal. Easily keeping 4 bars from long ranges (unlike my iPad 3).I love this tablet and easily recommend it over the ipad. While the ipad has a sharper image, it lacks power and runs much more sloppy than the note 8.0. The size, power, and price are perfect on the Note 8.0. The screen  is the perfect size for a tablet. And I highly recommend you get this tablet!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'What I\\'ve always hated about the i Phone is that it is a pain to punch letter by letter on the digital keyboard. I never want to write into anything on the web or for the Calendar. I am probably one of the last people that likes to \"write\" things down. So this note tablet is INCREDIBLE! It does everything that I want it to do. I am even writing this review on it which is taking about 25% of the time it would take me to pound it out with my fingertips! The write to text technology is amazing. I am using it for shopping lists, to do lists and to write better responses to emails when I don\\'t have access to a computer. Average battery life ranges from 1-2 days with good usage. The other great thing is that you can fit it easily into a purse unlike the full size iPad. I know there are all the reviews out there about it being a \"phablet\" but I would never want to use the note 8 as a phone. I am glad it only has wi-fi so that I am not wanting to use it all the time which is not healthy. Recommended for those that like to write, the S-Pen is fabulous!!!',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I\\'m a writer, one who finds she\\'s more productive writing longhand rather than typing directly into a file. So I\\'ve been writing longhand, and then typing my work into a file which is A) time consuming, and B) double wear and tear on hands and wrists.Now I don\\'t have to do both. =)With the S Pen, Dropbox, and MyScript Stylus app, my Note has become a writer\\'s dream tool. I write, it converts to text directly into the story file I\\'m working on, and every time I hit save, it\\'s uploaded to my Dropbox.That\\'s all I wanted it for: a dedicated writing device. It\\'s perfect for the job, not too big or heavy, and not so small that it\\'s difficult to write on the screen.I do have a few songs loaded on it, so that I can listen to music while writing, and the sound\\'s really good for such a device.The cons are few, and the main one would be all the dang pre-installed apps that you can\\'t delete. I intensely dislike having stuff on my devices I\\'m never going to use, and would rather have the storage space free. However, I\\'ve grown accustomed to it on my phone, so I guess I\\'ll do the same for my tablet.The other con is the size of the stylus. I realize it\\'s made to fit in the tablet, but you\\'d think a tool meant for frequent usage would be designed to be more comfy to hold and use for long periods of time. It\\'s not, so you may have to take frequent breaks to stretch your hand. The solution is to buy a \"cover\" that converts the stylus to regular pen size (which I\\'ve done).All in all, I\\'m extremely pleased with my purchase of this tablet, and am looking forward to using it for a long time.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I\\'ve been using this tablet for 6 months now mostly for taking notes in classes and meetings with an average use of a few hours a day.The accessories: a folio case with a stylus loop holder, anti glare screen protector, and a Wacom note stylus.  I have not rooted this or used any customized ROMs.Short review: After 6 mo, I still use this everyday for quite a few hours.  Great for note taking and pdf reading on the go.  However, those who intend to use this for hours of note taking and studying off of this should consider the 10.1 inch version, more screen real estate matters in this case.  The lack of quality accessory vendor partnership makes it harder to turn this into a full productivity work horse.Detailed review:The great things:- Compact and portable, much easier than carrying a 10.1 in tablet around- The stylus (the original and the Wacom one that I bought) work really well on the tablet.- Palm rejection is great on this. Though sometimes your hand might hit the \"back\" button on the lower right next to the home button.- I get about 6-7 hours of usage out of thisThe not so great things:- The screen resolution is not the sharpest out there, if you watch a lot of movies or need to have the best resolution, then this might not be for you. For casual users who focus mainly on taking notes and reading, I found this to be more than adequate.- Requires to have a high output charger.  The included charger is a 2.1A one, and this won\\'t charge when you plug it into a computer.- Almost no big time accessory vendor partnership.  This is still a niche product, all the accessories like keyboards and such are from less known vendors. While these still work great, they add unnecessary bulk.  Zagg makes a folio keyboard for this tablet that is really good but makes it hard to use the tablet for writing and is way over priced.- The included stylus is great but a bit too small to write comfortably for an extended period of time (>20 min).  I bought a Wacom stylus and found it to be much better, and it also has an eraser on the back so you can just use it like an eraser on the tablet.Thoughts on taking notes:I got this tablet to reduce the paper clutter and also to be able to remember and organize all the little notes that I take.  This tablet does all that and then some. The only adjustment that I made was make sure not to press down too hard while writing.  When writing on paper, we tend to press the ballpoint down a bit to get the ink out, but on the tablet screen this isn\\'t required.  Once you are adjusted to that, I find myself writing faster on the tablet than on paper.The big app on the tablet is the S Note.  My favorite feature is this \"Recording\" option in the app.  When you press the button, the app will record whatever your pen strokes are next.  This is fantastic for taking notes on equations or diagrams (ie those orgo reactions or physics equations) because when you hit replay, it will play back what you\\'ve written, stroke by stroke!  The downside about the app is that you can\\'t read it easily out of the tablet. You have to manually export it as a pdf or png (image) file as the actual note file is proprietary and there aren\\'t apps out there that can read it on a pc or mac easily.  Once you\\'ve exported, you also can\\'t edit it.  What i find myself using more is the LectureNotes app, which is really good.  Same idea as the S Note, but you can export it more easily into Evernote.If you are in college or taking classes and intend on using your tablet more like a productivity machine throughout your daily schedule, I would actually recommend the 10.1 inch version.  I think the 8.0 is great for meeting notes and writing on the go, but when you are dealing with hours of lectures and really have to study off of a tablet, the larger dimensions do make sense.  It is also easier to do multi window on a larger screen.  After 6 months of using this, I still find it to be fast and responsive.  The screen does heat up a bit if you are charging and using it at the same time.  I also suggest on getting a Wacom stylus, like the one here (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Eraser/dp/B009QW3SGQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1393774422&sr;=8-6&keywords;=wacom+galaxy+note+stylus).  The bigger size actually makes it a lot easier to write with.My only gripe is that there aren\\'t many quality, thin-profiled keyboard cases for this that are reasonably priced.  Because of the lack of quality accessory vendor support, I\\'m taking a star away in the rating.  For high profile products like this, I take into account of how the accessory support is when considering the final rating.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I own an iPad 1st gen and recieved this as a birthday present. After long and extensive research, I thought this tablet would be the perfect tablet for my school needs. I already own and iPhone 5s, so buying another iPad just seemed like having a giant version of my phone. After playing with my new tablet I can only think of two real issues with the tablet.Pros:-Perfect purse size tablet-Small and light-S-pen is an amazing feature-Quick response time-great screen resolution-samsung sends emails about different features supported by the note 8Cons:-it is 16gb before all the preinstalled apps provided by samsung. After realizing that the approximately free 9gb would not be enough space for me, I invested in a 32gb sd card. If considering this tablet, the sd card is a much needed accessory.-certain cases distort s-pen functionality. The resolution to this problem is to look for cases that do not have a magnet in the design.Honestly, I'm happy I recieved this tablet and I would recommend this tablet to others. However, do your own research before buying an expensive product like this. The Note 10.1 2014 edition was just released before I bought this one, but I liked the size of this one over the Note 10.1.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"If there\\u2019s only one thing I could say about this tablet, I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s the perfect device for me! What I personally love the most about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is the integrated S Pen, which comes with features, such as note-taking and handwriting-to-text, unique to this tablet that make it perfect for students. The fact that there\\u2019s many ways to personalize the home screens also attracted me to this tablet. I love the retro-looking appearance of this tablet, and its 8 inches makes it portable, perfect to fit in the palm of my hand! (The additional inch compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7-inch really makes a difference. It's perfect if your not looking for the size and cost of a larger tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet 10.1) The Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet is an efficient productivity tablet. Along with the S pen, It comes with a variety of other useful features, like the multi-window function that allows two apps to be open at once side-by-side (which is awesome to me);an infrared blaster, which can have the device as a remote control to any tv; and the eye sensor, which keeps the screen on as long as you\\u2019re looking at it. I praise this device\\u2019s great battery life, fast web browser speed, high video and speaker quality, 16GB storage, and decent front and rear camera. The Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet comes in an affordable $300 to $400 price range, yet I feel it is slightly overpriced for a mini tablet, but this tablet is worth it, especially with the inclusion of the S Pen and $400 worth of \\u201cGalaxy Perks\\u201d that come with purchase of this Galaxy device! The Samsung Galaxy Note is the perfect balance of work/school and fun. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone the S Pen stands out to and the avid note-taker, reader, and drawer. If the S Pen isn't for you I'd consider the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, ipad mini, or the Google Nexus 7 if your looking for a similar product.I had it for 10 days already and I absolutely love my awesome new tablet! It is everything I hoped for!\",\n",

While I have a Kindle Paperwhite and love it, the NOTE 8 has expanded my ability to enjoy all that is available on the internet.

       "   u'Content': u\"Bringing back the stylus of old resitive touchscreen technology has come with ridicule, but critics could not be more wrong. Combining technology of old with todays technological advancements offers a new valuable feature set that sets this tablet apart from the mainstream. With so many tablets offering virtually the same real world performace and feature set, when one comes out with a unique feature set it makes the decision of which to purchase much easier. As long as you know what that feature set has to offer you.PROS:The processor and memory allows you to breeze through menus and execute any operation to include any app currently available on the market without a hiccup. The screen is bright and clear with no notable differences side by side with my daughter's iPad Mini. Battery life is on par of all the others easily getting through a heavy days work without charge. However, these are not the features that should draw you toward this tablet as many have these same bragging rights at a smaller price. The precise control of the Wacom's 'S' pen technology is its defining feature. You can truly use this to replace pen and paper when taking notes during a lecture or meeting. Try the same thing with your finger or fat tipped touch capacitive stylus and you will quickly be back to a pen and paper after your notes end up looking worst than a 5 year old writing with a crayon. Refining pictures on photoshop is quicker than on a computer with a mouse and again offers the precision unmatched by any other (non-penabled) tablets. The same thing obviously holds true for artists or doodlers when using applications like Sketchbook plus adding the utility of pressure sensitivity for accurate shading without having to contstantly adjust through the menu. In addition to the 'S' pen, the IR sensor is more useful than I had imagined. I easily added all my TVs,  Bluray players, projector, receivers organized by room even my 15 year old Aiwa system. Granted the app could be a little better by adding easier access to more controls for each device but does well enough to bypass buying a $100+ Logitech remote.CONS:Samsung fanatics ardently back the use of plastic to encase their premium devices, but the look and feel simply does not match the quality exuded by Apple products or Asus's infinity tablets. Although I would love for Samsung to take note and offer a premium casing to match the rest of the device, adding a quality case easily remedies this minor complaint.OVERALL:Anyone who wants to use a tablet for everything from an powerful productivity tool at work or school to taking full advantage of art and photo apps should look no further than this or possibly a Note 10.1. Personally, I have found the 8.0 tablet as easily useful as 10 inchers with better form factor to use on the go, but those who plan on using it for more for graphical design might want the extra real estate at the cost of resolution. If you have no interest in jotting notes, utilizing photo or art apps then save money and get a Nexus 7 or one of the other countless counterparts with similar features, otherwise look no further as the price of Note 8.0 is easily justified\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'So to start off, I do think that the $399 price tag is a bit much, which is why I\\'m giving it four stars, but besides that, this tablet is pretty darn great. I\\'m a painter/illustrator and while I wouldn\\'t use this for anything official (unless it\\'s my last resort), this does make for a great on-the-go digital sketchbook. The S-Pen is accurate enough that drawing on it is almost as accurate as writing with a physical pen and paper. There\\'s still a tiny TINY bit of lag if you\\'re used to Wacom tablets but it\\'s probably not noticeable to most people, and out of all the Android tablets I\\'ve tried this has been THE most accurate. It won\\'t replace a Wacom Cintiq but as I mentioned, is great for sketching, best coupled with Autodesk apps. The S-Note app is great but it\\'s pretty limited as an actual drawing or painting program.Other features that can be useful for artists would be the Multi-Window feature. I haven\\'t used it much as of now but I can see it becoming very useful when researching and note taking. Another one would be the aNote HD app. I wish they renamed it because it sounds like an amateur app but it\\'s a great organizer. So if you\\'re the type that has a lot of ideas, thoughts, notes and events that you need to document, this app would make things easier for you. It\\'s pretty detailed as well, so you can make sure that all your entries are neatly organized and properly labeled in a fashionable manner. The S-Note has the same, though more S-Pen dependent features, and as far as I can remember, both the aNote and S-Note can work together, so that\\'s handy.As far as drawbacks, I know it sounds odd but the system sounds are very limited. For example, the system sounds for pressing buttons, locking and unlocking are all water-drop themed. I\\'m not sure why Samsung had to pick such a specific sound instead of a sound that has mass appeal. You can\\'t even change it to something else, you either have it on or off, which is a bummer if you want a more professional sounding tablet, but I digress. The screen does get smudged easier than say, a Nexus 7 but I guess that can be countered by buying a screen protector or having a handy tablet-friendly cloth wipe.Another drawback is that even though the system is marketed as 16gb, I only have 9gb of available memory. I\\'ve used less than a gig of memory so far and it\\'s disappointing that the system is close to being full - by today\\'s typical memory consumption standards. I know that companies always market devices at a certain amount only to find that a few gigs have been removed when you get the device, but 9gb from 16gb is a bit absurd. So just a warning, you should buy an SD card if you need more than that. You technically do get a 50gb Dropbox account - though it has yet to appear on my account, might have to activate it? - and have the ability to access your Google Drive, assuming you have one, which technically gives you around an extra 65gb if you\\'re connected to the internet, but if you want memory on the go, I suggest just buying a memory card if you can.Overall I do love this device. I wish it was cheaper, but whatever. If you\\'re an artist and looking for a good tablet to draw on, you can\\'t really beat the Note 8.0. As far as I know, Wacom themselves provide the pressure sensitive technology so you\\'re in good hands. I might trade it in or sell it when the REAL Wacom tablet comes out, but who knows when that will be. In the mean time, this will do the job.PS, If you\\'re debating between the 10.1 and the 8.0 and size isn\\'t an issue, I recommend the 8.0 because the 10.1\\'s screen isn\\'t as responsive compared to the 8.0. The only thing that can beat the 8.0 in the near future would be the upcoming Samsung ATIV tablets which also sports the S-Pen, but those are more closer to being computers than tablets. So basically if you like the 8\" size and would need the S-Pen functionality, it\\'s worth the money.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"From the beginning of my tablet search I was dead set on purchasing an iPad mini.  I have an iphone, an ipod classic, ipod touch and an ipod shuffle and have had good experiences with Apple products and didn't see any reason not to get an Apple tablet.  I didn't like the regular iPad due to size and weight so the mini was in my sights.  However, the one thing that held me back was the screen resolution of the iPad mini and the fact that Apple would likely release an improved mini 2 with better resolution and better processor.  I'm not saying that the current mini screen and processor is bad but knowing that it could be a lot better kept me from purchasing it.  So I decided to wait for the mini 2...and so I waited...and waited and then something interesting happened.  I decided to poke my foot outside of the Apple universe and see what other tablets were on the market and I came across some articles about the Samsung Note 8 and what intrigued me was the S pen.  This is my first tablet purchase and I wanted something that I could use for work in addition to home and the S pen seemed like a great feature.  I've always wanted to reduce all the paper clutter around my desk and having all my notes electronic was very appealing.  When I tried the Note 8 out at a local Best Buy, I was sold.  A lot of the key features and highlights have already been described in previous reviews so no need to repeat them here.  My primary use for the tablet is for note taking, productivity tasks, reading ebooks, and surfing the net (checking emails, news, stocks).  Occasionally, I would use it to play some games and watch movies to kill time if I was traveling.  After a couple of weeks of usage I can say that I am happy with my purchase with a drawback that, in my opinion, keeps this from being a 5 star tablet.The drawback is trying to get movies onto the Note 8 without having to shell out additional $$ to purchase the movie in the Google Play store.  I have numerous blu ray discs that come with a digital copy of the movie.  Therefore, I can't justify shelling out another $15 to buy the android version of the movie.  I have found in a lot of cases the blu ray digital copy can be accessed either through Ultraviolet streaming which can be done via a Flixster app or a copy can be downloaded to a phone or tablet IF you have iTunes.  Right off the bat, I know that I will not be able to copy a digital movie from iTunes to an Android tablet.  So there doesn't seem to be a way to get those digital movies onto the Note 8.  On the other hand it's a cinch to move them onto an Apple phone or tablet with iTunes.  So my next option was to see if I can stream the movie via Ultraviolet/Flixster, which is not my first choice because its a wi-fi only tablet.  The problem is Flixster will not allow you to stream Ultraviolet movies if you have a rooted device.  Which is all well and good if you don't root your device but if you don't root your device then you can't have Flash Player running when you browse the web.  In my opinion, Flash makes the web experience better and that's why my device is rooted.  To go through the process of unrooting, and then streaming and then re-rooting seems like an inconvenience. I have Amazon Prime so I tried to stream movies from Prime but to my dismay I could not find the Amazon Instant Video app in the Google Play store.  They have it for the iTunes App store but not for Android.  What???  At the end of the day, this drawback was enough to prevent me from giving this product a perfect score of 5 stars primarily because it seems like an iPad would have less roadblocks to overcome when compared to the Note 8 in order to copy or play movies.  Again, this is not to say that the Note 8 is a bad product, the S pen is terrific, the size is perfect, the speed is top notch...its just my experience thus far with trying to use it for movies has been less than great.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"When I first got my hands on the Note about 10 weeks ago I was pretty excited and having a great time with it. The screen, initial battery life, s-pen, and speed of the tablet were great. I come from an all-apple background but have recently switched to Android because of the greater freedom they allow. The first problem that was apparent was actually getting the benefits that the tablet purports to come with such as the Google Play credit. It took me two weeks of back and forth with Samsung to get the credit applied to my google account. A problem, should you look at their facebook support page, seems to be very widely experienced. Disappointing but nonetheless handled and now out of the way. Reckoned it was time for me to enjoy my tablet.I love the screen, I think 8 inches is just the best size for reading coupled with an excellent screen. The ergonomics are great even wrapped in a case, good weight and an acceptable camera. The tablet is also quite good in power, I play Shadowgun (3D FPS) and it looks great and runs smooth.The S-Pen is pretty sweet and enjoyable as a method of input combined with the one-hand ergonomics of the tablet. Nice for scribbling, drawing, and text input. However, according to the adverts I assumed I could use the pen to cut out imagery from a variety of things, like Googlemaps for example, and pull it into an email or note-program and annotate it easily. Turns out this isn't the case at all. Most programs, including the note programs included in the note won't allow the s-pen cut-out images to be imported into them. aNote HD allows it somewhat, but image resolution is ridiculously grainy and illegible if it contains text. I've watched the instructive videos on youtube but they have not illuminated anything new that would allow this. Comments are completely welcome on this front.QUALITY PROBLEMS ARE KILLING THIS FOR MEHowever, within 1 month, and without any drops or rough handling of the tablet (I keep it in a case at all times), a hairline crack starting forming on the top bezel, just above the Samsung logo. I immediately contacted Samsung through their facebook support page but never received a response. Within another week the crack had stretched across the whole top bezel and another one appeared on the upper side of the power button on the side bezel. I again used the facebook page as well as the direct service support on Samsung's website. To this day I have not received any response to my problems. Not only is the build quality lacking on the tablet, but non-existent customer service has radically changed my perception of Samsung's products for the worse.Furthermore, I purchased the tablet as a computer substitute for graduate school and the Note 8.0's long battery life was one of the primary determinants for purchase. However, unlike the first several weeks of 11 hours, the battery life has dropped by hours and I'm lucky if I get 7 with moderate use and conservative power-settings. If I turn on the Wifi and surf, it may can drop another few hours. Moreover, the battery will often drop very rapidly and have had the tablet suddenly shutdown showing 0% life without any warning (Typically a warning pops at 15 & 5%). When the tablet is around 35% range, it can hit zero within 30 minutes. Charging is also showing irregularity, more than once I have left it to charge overnight, heard the affirmative charging sound, and wake to find it at 0% despite having been 30-40% when I plugged it in (Furthermore I turned it off while charging).Bizarre, and I would assume this tablet is clearly defective but I have so far failed to get anyone at Samsung to pay attention to me. I thought Samsung was the top of the heap in terms of Android products, especially for a tablet that's well-more expensive than its competition. Despite my disagreements with Apple's accessibility, I'm thinking perhaps the hardware and software quality trade-off may not be worth it.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'This is Excellent for the price.  I\\'ve owned one for close to a year, and its the perfect balance between a 5\" and 10\".  Most people won\\'t be happy with the resolution of the screen, but I think its just fine especially for taking notes.  Speed is fine for browsing and writing, although at times it can have trouble with intense games. I\\'ve owned the new Note 10.1 2014 version, and the Note 2, and I actually enjoy the Note 8.0 much better (to each their own) than either of them.  Yes the 10.1 2014 version has a nicer screen and higher specs, but if you\\'re using this tablet for Note taking or drawing, higher everything also meant draining the battery quickly.  I just shut off the Wi-fi, turn down the screen to 35-50%, and I\\'m set for hours in school. Also, although the new S-note has nice new shiny excellent features, there is obvious lag in the pen, and you can\\'t use detailed erasing when drawing like the note 8.0.  In erase mode, once you touch the current piece you have written, the eraser will remove EVERYTHING.  There are no settings to remove this.  The Note 8.0 uses very detailed erasing, and writing is very smooth.For those that are wondering if the Note 8.0 is good for taking notes at school, I\\'d say yes.  I\\'ve used it through 3 hour classes no problem,  and its easy to write and erase things during class.  Once I hit 60-70%, I attach a portable battery to it and juice it back to 100%.  Place the tablet in landscape, and its easy to write.  Pinch to zoom for detailed writing and you can pan around the screen using the same two fingers while dragging them along to the spots you\\'d like to view (at times it feels like an old type writer when pulling the page back to the beginning of the next line).  Its great for kids to practice their ABC\\'s, just be sure to properly protect it and keep an eye on the S-pen.S-note is decent, but I prefer using the app Lecture Notes.  It costs $5, but well worth the cost if you like to customize your note taking and download PDF\\'s to write over.  I sometimes download Coloring Book PDF\\'s for my niece to draw on and save myself from buying books and crayons.  Its also great when a professor emails PDF\\'s for class because you can highlight important information.  I\\'d sometimes \"white out\" terms, study the content, then remove the \"white out\" portions to check if I was correct on the term.  Its and excellent tool.In the end, its all about personal preference.  I like the balance of an 8\" tablet, vs bigger or smaller versions.  I think I spent too much money at the time I purchased this gadget, but if the tablet is in the $200 range, I\\'d say its worth every penny.  Spend time with it, and you\\'ll be very happy with this device.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Pros: Small form factor, long battery life, good suite of pre-installed programs, SD-card up-gradable, stylus works perfectly, lightweight, recent OS can run any Android apps (as of this writing), IR blaster for remote control capability, great stylus shortcuts, easy screen captures, practically anything can be \"shared\" to other apps (like Gmail, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.), bright and clear screen, very customizable interface, charges pretty quickly, makes a good e-Reader, usable for personal and professional tasks.Cons: Templates in S-Note are very difficult to create and customize; takes some tech know-how.  It\\'s slow to notify you of things you already knew (tells you that you plugged in headphones several minutes after the fact while watching a movie, for example). Battery is not really replaceable by the user without taking it apart. The Kit Kat Android OS hasn\\'t been pushed out to it yet (as best I can tell).Recommending tablets is a funny business; we all use them for different things. I am comfortable with Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS, so I can adapt. If you\\'re an iPad-only person, this will take some time to get used to. If you\\'re a Microsoft person, same thing. I think it\\'s very intuitive though, and love all the shortcuts for opening apps, taking screenshots and partial screen captures, taking/editing photos on the fly, etc.  If it weren\\'t for just a couple apps that are iPad-only, I\\'d switch to this device exclusively.I do a good amount of handwriting on my tablet, so the size is becoming a limitation for me personally. Will probably upgrade to the new 12\" Note Pro that was just released so I have more space to write naturally. But if you\\'re looking for a good tablet in the 7-8\" range, this one is highly recommended. I can\\'t think of much I would suggest to the manufacturer for new features, other than a few bug fixes here or there.BTW, I bought mine refurbished and haven\\'t had a single issue with it.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I love my Note 8. It's fast, productive and stylish, You can read all the accolades by other reviewers. My review is focused on the Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) connection. Instead of having a mcro-HDMI it has the MHL. This means I have to connect a MHL adapter to my device, a hdmi cable from the adapter to the laptop, PC or TV (some adapter have built-in HDMI cable), and connect my power adapter from a power source to my MHL adapter. The purpose of the power source is to power the device since HD video can consume a lot of battery. The problem is that I have all these cables hanging from my device. I tried giving a presentation in my class and it was so cumbersome and restrictive because of the length of my power cable. Also, I was concerned about the weight of all the cables on my MHL port. I don't want the charging port on my device to become loose because of these cables hanging off of it.My Kindle HD 7' has a micro HDMI connection. I connect my 6ft micro HDMI to HDMI cable between the device and my laptop/ PC or TV and give seamless presentations, or watch Prime, Netflix, Youtube, etc without a hitch. With the Note 8 it is cumbersome because of the added power source. I have returned to using my Fire HD for giving presentations in professional settings instead of the Note 8.I would give the Note 8 a solid 4 stars (even 4.5 stars) if it wasn't for this issue. You would think that Samsung would have thought about this if it wanted to pitch the Note 8 towards students and professionals. As stated, love my Note 8 except for the MHL and giving presentations or watching video on my HDTV.\",\n",

I'm normally an early adopter but held out for years and years through Palm Pilots and PDAs and smartphones and various iPads and waited for the perfect thing - this.  The s-pen is perfect, I use it for writing (amazing hand writing recognition) and drawing (I use PS Touch and ArtFlow, both excellent).  I stream video from my PC, and seamless sync my calendar and email.  It's small enough to tuck in my bag and large enough to be usable.  Sometimes (when drawing) I wonder if I should have chosen the Note 10.0, but in balance this size is the best for me. After some research I ordered the perfect screen protector, MiniGuard by MiniSuit,which does not interfere with the S-pen, and got a sweet case with a swivel stand for almost nothing from the same place (through Amazon).I could go on but suffice to say there is nothing I do not like about my Galaxy Note 8; it is worth every penny.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Since I bought an Android 4.0 Media Player back in 2011, I always wanted a high end tablet but didn't have the money. The media player is great on the go but has drawbacks such as poor battery life, four inch screen, and low specs. 1 GHz processor and 486 MB RAM. My mom opted to buy one for me as I didn't have the money to afford one.Today I found at Staples they were selling it for $299.99! But I went over to Best Buy and they price matched Staples as my mom was buying other items from there. I wanted the black color, instead of white and brown was unavailable. Originally I wanted to buy the Google 7 32 GB but passed on it. I read average reviews online and spoke to people who didn't like using it. Also ASUS has poor customer service in helping and fixing problems.When I came home, I opened the brown box and began to use it. Very easy to use. Thankfully Samsung still uses Micro SD cards. The tablet loads up immediately as well as the Micro SD card. The sound is fantastic! If you think two small speakers can't produce great sound, think again! I didn't have to raise the volume way up. I still have it on low and the sound is loud. Easy to use interface. Long battery life as long as you don't run games and video's all the time. I like to browse the internet quickly. But this is thanks to the 1.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor with 2 GB of RAM.My family has owned Samsung products for many years. We never had problems with any of them. TV's, camera's, Refrigerator, and now our first tablet. Will will continue to buy Samsung.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I have been purchasing Sam Tabs since the Galaxy Tab 2 7.  Since then I have had the Tab 2 10.1 and the famous and wish they would have kept improving Tab 7.7 which I still have. I also have the Note 2 and a first gen iPad. I wouldn\\'t have even purchased the Note 8 if I had not cracked my screen on the 7.7.  Glad I did purchase it though.  It\\'s faster and showed the age of my 7.7 with how it handles the whole experience of using a tablet.  I won\\'t go thru all the tech stuff that many have submitted.  But I can address the issue of the upgrade to Jellybean 4.2.2.  Samsung must have corrected the problem that many have described where the multi-window functionality stopped working after installing it.  Mine not only worked fine but to my surprise and pleasure, the unit installed all my apps that I had on my 7.7 and afterwards installed the upgrade with no loss of data.  It even restored all my photos that i had on my other units;I purchased the Moko slim case with a magnet.  It may be a little early to tell if it\\'s the magnet or not but every now and then when I fold the flap in back of the tablet hand touches are nonresponsive.  Oddly enough though, the pen still worked.  If I turn it off and back on again the hand touches worked again.  I will use it without the case for a day or 2 to see if that is the problem.  I heard this unit has had problems with magnetized covers.  Otherwise, the experience I have with this tablet is very similar to what I have with the Note 2.  Excellent.  My only gripe is that it didn\\'t come with a better display.  The colors are beautiful and reading text are sharp but the movie experience is no where near as crisp as the Note 2 or even as crisp as my Galaxy 7.7.  Another complaint that i have read is the size of the bezel.  What a silly quibble.  My 7.7 has the exact same size bezel and it was haled as one of the best tablets of its time.  The thing cost $700 without contract when it came out and now we pay 3-400 for a tab that is more powerful and feature rich and complain it cost too much.  i tried using the other tablets with a thinner bezel and my hand kept touching the darn screen activating various apps I didn\\'t want loaded.Plastic is another issue.  Almost all tablets are made of either plastic or aluminum or a combination of the 2.  Look and feel are subjective preferences but to use a tablet without having a protective cover is not very wise imho.Once you place a cover on it, look and feel go out the window anyway.One more quibble.  Battery life.  Not the greatest.  The note 2 lasts all day with heavy use.  I have never been able to max it out even watching movies, surfing, gaming, using the phone etc.  The Note 8 not so much.  You have to put it on power saving mode to get the best life out of it.  I have only had it for 2 days and I already had to charge it once and right now it\\'s at 74%.  Shame on you Samsung.  My Galaxy 7.7 gets better battery life.  But then again it has a super amoled plus display that uses less power with more punch in color and vibrance.  Better blacks too.Even with these caveats, the Note 8 is a great tablet to use and since it is a tablet and not a phone you get true \"desktop\" web browsing, more screen realestate and Samsung Note apps and usability to boot.  Not bad for $289.  If you want the magazine UI you can download Chameleon Launcher and get the best of both worlds.  Just thought I\\'d through that in for free.  The launcher needs a little work but it does change the way you see and utilize your tablet.  Better categorizing of home screens etc.Would I recommend the Note 8.0?  Now that you can get at a price point that competes with iPad mini, Nexus 7 and LG G8.3... Yeahhh!',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I had it narrowed down to this tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014), and possibly an iPad (comparable in price to the Note 10.1).I saw this one for $230, factory refurbished. The price was irresistible.I couldn't be happier. I was concerned that the screen was a little to small. I use this mainly for watching videos (often on plane rides) and grading papers (college-level Math homework).I got a (free) Android app for annotating PDF's that I use to grade papers electronically. Having the stylus is indispensable for this purpose, especially because it's very difficult to type Mathematical symbols into any word processor. One can use typesetting software, but this is very impractical when you just want to grade papers.Streaming video over wifi (ESPN3, HBOGO, Netflix) works very well. For plane rides, the Android video player works very well. I have to convert some video files to mp4, but there is viable software on the internet (cost-free) to do this. The battery has been more than sufficient for flying coast-to-coast (unlike my old laptop's battery).I highly recommend the Galaxy Note 8.0. I was a little concerned that the screen would be too small, but I find it to be perfect for my purposes. I like Apple products very much, but I don't think I would be as satisfied with an iPad for its lack of stylus and inflexibility with video playback. (And no, I'm not converting back to Windows or Linux, I still love my MacBook and I'll get another when it dies (6 years and going).)\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Fast, smooth, and what I hoped for in a smaller portable tablet.  The split screen is excellent.  The stylus is very useful; takes a bit of practice.  Apps noted as optimized for phone work very well on this tablet (just bigger).Easy to set up out of the box, be ready to log in your Samsung and Google accounts.  Will then import in all your Google and Samsung apps and info.One quirk to be prepared to handle - some users, including me, have a problem when the tablet automatically upgrades from android 4.1.2 (out of box) to 4.2.2.  This happens right away.  I soon noticed that the multi screen feature and the quick screen did not work.  Could not fix.  Went to blogs and learned that this is a known problem (thanks Samsung).  The solution is not as scary as it sounds.  Go to settings,backup and select factory reset.  Reinstalls 4.1.2.  Will automatically update to 4.2.2 again, but this time without the error noted above.  Joy, except you now have to set up the tablet all over again.  Any apps and preferences you earlier set have to be redone.  Cost me a half hour or so.Once past that unpleasantness, great experience and great tablet.  Definitely get the Google keyboard as it is superior to the Samsung keyboard; Swype is so fast.The processor is fast! The integration is excellent.  Widgets are excellent.  The Google apps work well together (definitely look into most all of them).  Screen is sharp and as bright as you desire it to be.  Tablet form factor excellent and easy with one hand (OK, I am a male and have a good sized hand).  Battery life good; I charged when I opened it Tue afternoon and all night Tue and still have 27% battery late Thursday night (full disclosure - I only use a bit at breakfast and after work).I would but this tablet again and really like it.  Amazon delivered in two days as promised and charged $30 less than the competition.',\n",

I own a Macbook, however hate carrying it around everywhere because of how much space it take up.

What I will say is the s-pen is a lot more useful than I imagined it to be. I use it to take notes for a language class I am taking. As others know, it's difficult to type in another language, especially if you don't have a keyboard with the keys you need. I didn't want to deal with generating more paper waste since I tend to use a lot of scrap paper. This has replaced all my scrap paper. The size of this is perfect that I carry it around with me almost as much as my phone.The thing I would recommend Samsung to improve is some sort of wrist recognition by the buttons. when writing on lecturenotes or s-notes, my wrist tends to hit the back button. I avoid this by using the tablet in widescreen mode as it gives me more writing space while moving the buttons out of the way.\",\n",

Using it without character recognition I can keep my attention on what's going on in the meeting. Having to deal with character recognition is worse than using the virtual keyboard, in other words it takes too much attention away from meetings. I otherwise use the character recognition for all other input (like now).I'd use it more with multi-user support - that's a endearing feature. I would also appreciate Web access to my S-note cloud backup. I'm left to assume that the only way to get access to my notes if my tablet dies or disappears is to go buy a new device and restore. This doesn't strike me as efficient or optimal.l find the 8-inch size ideal. It's fun to have portable copies of docs on my tablet instead of paper, and I can mark them up or point using Polaris Office while attached to a projector. A few at the office have followed suit and got themselves work tablets. Those with the Note are happy.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 from a 1st Generation iPad and couldn't be more pleased.  The device is compact but has a great screen and the S-pen works well for reviewing PDFs and highlighting (primary functions for me).  It fits in a medical lab coat quite well and holds a charge without issue.Only cons are the preloaded Samsung software (messaging, etc.) that I know I'll never use.  Otherwise it's perfect.I bought mine on Amazon's Warehouse Deals at a significant savings.  While I was initially a bit worried about buying a returned item the return policy eased my anxiety.  Besides preowned appearing packaging I wouldn't have known I wasn't the first owner.  It was definitely worth buying from the Warehouse.3 month update:  I'm still liking this tablet a lot and has a good mix of productivity and entertainment capability.  I was briefly swayed by the new Google Nexus 7 but this tablet has been a great fit.  The s-pen is indispensible for working with pdfs and when using the note taking software.  It does a great job of capturing my handwriting quickly and accurately.  The included Polaris Office allows one to manage office files on the go and to review presentations without having to buy additional software.  I have used it on multiple flights and the video playback is very nice.Bottom line:  This is a great business and entertainment tablet that is a quantum leap from my iPad 1.  If you don't need to work with highlighting/note taking then the s-pen may not hold a lot of value for you and you may be served better by Samsung's other s-pen-less tablets.  If your priorities are gaming/HD video/the crispest screen then look at the Nexus or retina iPads.  If you want a well-balanced tablet that's reasonably priced and offers the expanded capability of the s-pen then look no further.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Edit:  I recently started using Layerpaint HD (a tablet optimized version of Layerpaint with layer modes) and the experience has improved even more.  I can now confidently create finished artwork with it.The Note 8 is an outstanding tablet.  It is very capable for media consumption, such as music, video or even ebooks; all in a neat portable package.  I personally bought it for the previous reasons, but also for the possibility of drawing and painting with the most natural input possible.  Using the Layerpaint app, I have integrated it seamlessly into my workflow*; when the mood strikes I just jot a sketch or two and either finish it right there on the spot, or continue at home with my PC.What advantages does it offer against the competition?1)Wacom technology.  It has 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, which should make your line work look more natural.  Heck, you can easily calibrate the stylus (and even the app, in some cases) if you dislike the pressure curve or the \"cursor\" precision!2)The S-Pen has a small tip!  While some people have enough ability to create art with any tool, I am not skilled enough.  Having a smaller contact point with the screen gives me more control and precision, as opposed to using my fingertip or a fat stylus.3)Can handle high resolution, multi-layer files.  With the app I mention above, I have even created 300 DPI and 600 DPI files.  Why is that significant? Because that\\'s print quality, and you can continue whatever you start in the Note 8 with your laptop and be ready for print or web with minor compromises.The one con, and it\\'s a big one, is that currently there are not as many drawing/painting apps as for iOS, but it\\'s a situation that will be resolved over time; Wacom just released an Android based professional tablet that should move things along in that department.  If you look around though, you will find an app or two that will fulfill your needs, and who knows, it could end up becoming an important part of you art routine too.*My current digital only setup is:  Note 8 + Layerpaint HD + Windows 8 Laptop + Wacom Intuos 3 + Manga Studio EX 5.  I do use a standalone Samsung S-Pen which I tweaked to make the pressure sensitivity a bit firmer.Manga Studio 5Manga Studio EX 5Wacom Intuos3 6 x 8-Inch Pen TabletSamsung Galaxy S-Pen Stylus Pen with Eraser for Galaxy Note II',\n",

It's very responsive and comes with some of the apps I need...the others can be found in the Google play store. For those who complain about the manual/instructions not being included...there are lots of You tube videos explaining everything...hence a manual is NOT necessary. If you have used an android device before and loved it you would love this device, the stylus is the best part.. I am hesitant about updating from 4.1.2 to 4.2.2 after reading about others experiences. I will update if I do.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Since I love my Galaxy Note 2 (and I am an S Pen user), I wanted my next tablet to be a Note 8.0. A factory refurb for under $200 sealed the deal. I was disappointed that the 8.0 did not have some of the simple features of my Note 2:  No LED notification light when you have a message/email/etc.; no S pen keeper which sounds an alert and shows a pop up when you walk away with your device without attaching the S Pen; none of the cool writing features where, for example you make a written mistake and you can cross a line through it to delete the text or draw a line between letters to make a space. On the 8, you have to erase the entire word using the back button.  Also, the S Pen on the 2 pops out easily when you push it; the 8 requires you to really dig it out of its hole! Perhaps most of this can be fixed with a simple Android version upgrade (mine is 4.2.2)The good stuff:  Unlike the Note 2, the S Pen does work with the settings and return buttons at the bottom of the tablet (on the Note 2, you have to press it with your finger which is a pain with pen in hand).  The S Pen is slightly longer on the 8.0 which makes it easier to write.  The larger space to write has really helped my accuracy. and has me more interested in S Notes. It boots up quickly and is very responsive.  The size is perfect for portability (though a tad heavier than I anticipated) particularly for using the pen while holding it. The picture is sharp though I am still prefer my Kindle book when reading books.Overall I am very happy with the tablet and I hope the next Android  software upgrade will bring some of the features I love in my Note 2.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I have been impressed more and more by Samsung's efforts with the various Android devices and platforms.  After getting a couple of Tab2 7.0 tablets for my wife and son last year, I began to consider a tablet upgrade for myself.  I purchased a Toshiba Thrive a couple of years ago and I enjoy it very much, but it was starting to look a lot slower next to these newer devices.  After some deliberation, I elected to go with the Note 8.0.  After several months of use, I am very pleased with my decision.  The slightly non-standard size of the Note 8.0 has made getting some accessories more challenging, but the device features make the trade off worth it for me.  The biggest draw and feature is of course, the S-Pen.  I have found it to be very versatile and helpful.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I bought this tablet refurbished \\u2013 After reading the mostly good reviews, I figured it was a less expensive way to give it a try. I have two ipad minis at home and a Samsung Tab2 which is STILL relevant and keeping up with our requirements that include streaming video from our NAS, games, book reading, email/ browsing and media room remote.Anyway, bought for $200 bucks \\u2013 refurbished. It came in, looks brand new, at power on it took me through the initial set up which is idiot proof \\u2013 not sure I understand some of the reviews that claim they don\\u2019t know how to get going on it (I should mention it did not come with a manual, it did come with a link to it which I have yet to feel the need to download), and then it was off to the races.Super quick. Quicker than the minis and my Tab2 (which I guess is no surprise). Was not however, expecting it to be noticeably quicker than the minis though\\u2026and it is.Great size at 8\\u201d 16:9 ratio. Movies fit real nice. Super wifi connectivity and speed (it actually tells you what your link speed is which I found cool). Image quality absolutely leaves the ipad minis behind, sharp, sharp and bright colors . The s pen is a really cool feature did not think I would care about it, but it feels like you are really writing /drawing with the sensitivity of the integrated Wacom digitizer\\u2026.Button placement is fine\\u2026I do tend to activate the menu button here and there on accident, but then again I seem to activate apps on the minis by accident as well so I guess it just doesn\\u2019t bother me as much as some other reviewers.LOVE the fact that you can turn these puppies into a single remote for every room in the house. LOVE the sd card that you can load with 64 gb of whatever junk you like to carry in it ( loaded a couple movies an 40 gb of family pics (tablet has been in someone\\u2019s hands since I got it). Surprising from my girls whom I swore had the minis glued permanently to their hands.Quite happy so far but just got it this week-end. Will update in a few weeks and see if I am still enamored. So far yes. Oh and for $200 bucks? I am beginning to like this whole \\u201crefurbished\\u201d way to get some of these otherwise pricey gadgets.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"As a college student, I was really looking for something that did EVERYTHING without having the price to show for it. I bought my boyfriend the galaxy tab and thought it was great, so I really went back and forth trying to decide if the note was worth the extra cost.. let me just say it IS. The seemingly minor adjustments to the features actually make a huge difference, and the note taking capabilities literally are a life saver. I sync up my phone and touchpad calendars to keep me in order, eliminated the cost of buying notebooks for school, saved myself the hassle of lugging around my laptop for movies, and use the dual-screen capabilities on a daily basis. It's such a simple layout and the battery lasts forever. The resolution is really nice as well and I often times will use my touchpad for playing music in the morning while getting ready as well. I love being able to put it in my purse, and at the same time have it be big enough to watch movies and tv on.Con: restricted to only certain apps for dual screen.. but still many more than on the galaxy s4!Not sure if it does screen mirroring or s beam... that would be nice.Just all around a wonderful decision. So happy I spent the extra money on the note.\",\n",

Of all the tablets that I've owned, used or looked into, this is my favorite...Also, in case it's useful: I primarily use the tablet for taking notes, sending emails, reading, playing games, and sometimes, watching movies...Pros:1. Love the stylus -- I find it so useful for emails, etc. I've gotten amazingly fast with swype etc and actually get frustrated when I have to actually type-type with my thumbs, on a smart phone!!!2. It's a great size for most of the activities I like -- I use a kindle app for reading (other apps as well sometimes), it's great for watching movies, etc and wonderful for all the little stupid games I'm addicted to.3. It's generally light-weight and travels well4. Takes pictures etc well, though I honestly use that feature very, very rarely as I find it to be an awkard size for that particular function.5. This is a sillier one, but as a mom, I love the photo wall feature that zips through the pictures of my kids I have... (though I'm sure it's part of my battery-life-problem, see below)Cons:1. Mostly just the battery life. I think the battery on both of my Nexus(es) was better. When I've been really gaming, etc. it feels like the batter just drains.2.Though I've had my current one for a few months, the first one I bought actually had to be sent back (its battery drained within the hour) but I had no problems returning it, liked it enough to ask for the replacement (as opposed to just refund) and have loved this one.\",\n",

Has a good battery life (iPad: 10  -  Galaxy Note:  6)2.  Worked with all my office documents (iPad:  5  -  Galaxy Note (with One Note & Kingsoft Office): 8)3.  Was easy to access and use when crunched for time in an airport (iPad & Galaxy Note: 10)I am VERY pleased with the Galaxy Note 8.  The features I like best are:1.  Android OS - more free apps and overall cost of apps is less; more flexibility in customizing; similar OS as my Moto Razr Maxx2.  Very fast processor3.  great memory.  I have a large number of apps and it NEVER gets bogged down due to too many things running4.  I've added a keyboard and case that helps with productivity5.  Quality and brightness of the screen: exceptional!  Although not OLED, i am very pleased with the screen6.  The touch and feel of the screen are perfect.7.  I don't use the S Pen as much as I thought I would, but is very nice to have when I choose to use it.The size of the Galaxy Note 8 is the most difficult thing for me to get used to.  Not the screen size, per se, but the size and feel of the Note itself.  It is just too big for me to comfortably hold in one hand, but still smaller than the full size iPad i used before.  By this I am not complaining about the screen size, I think the screen size is very good. Rather, it is just a bit awkward feeling but I am getting more used to it.\",\n",

This is an excellent tablet!! It is the quiet type of unknown tablet especially to the masses sired to Nexus and iPad devices. As in until you use it and experience it...you really do not know it.  I use this for reading books and it is by far the best book reader I have ever used.  I have iPad 4 and I rarely use it anymore.  Screen quality is excellent of course it is not retina but text and video are excellent. Hulu, Netflix, Youtube are all \"Ribabosha!!!\" Extremely beautiful screen. Typical of Samsung. I use Apex launcher (and that is not because touchwiz is bad) I just prefer Apex.  it runs smooth, I use Bing, Chrome and Dolphin browsers with dolphin being the primary browser of choice.  This tablet just works, it has no issues, the touch screen is responsive and all them stylus features work excellente!!! I use this mostly for kindle.  It is a joy and the battery life is stupendous. I usually charge the device once a week (Wednesdays). The greatest feature of this tablet is, it has a remote controller which controls everything in a home that is the TV, Cable box and in my case a projector as well.  It is astounding!  This tablet too will run anything you throw at it...Dead trigger 2, Asphalt 8...name it... etc etc. That Quadcore Exynos processor powering this tablet just runs applications fast, smooth, easy. The Galaxy Note 8.0 just works!  It is everything in a simple easy to carry wonderful \"Ribabosha!!!\" tablet.  Sometimes it is good to look different from the rest of the crowd and this tablet has your back on that.  Thank you Samsung!',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I took the plunge on a refurbished Note 8 and couldn\\'t be happier. I have owned many pen devices over the years, from the original Compaq iPaq, IBM Wacom based Thinkpads, and the original Galaxy Note phone. I\\'m going to start this review by saying don\\'t buy this tablet if you don\\'t want a pen based device... there are cheaper options that will fill the tablet role without the added cost of the Wacom pen. If you are still reading, I\\'ll assume you want a device with a real pen.The Note 8 is the perfect size for a note taking device. The Galaxy Note I phone I own and love just wasn\\'t big enough to make the pen really useful for me. The design of the tablet is simple, with gently curved corners and a fairly wide bezel. The lack of an easily removable back provides decent rigidity that makes it feel less creaky than my phone. The back can be removed for a fairly easy battery replacement... but it is not meant to be swapped in and out like a phone battery.  I wish Samsung didn\\'t put the big chrome logo on top, but it is what it is.The pen is slightly longer and fatter than the pen that comes with the Note phones. It is mostly round, with a flat side where the button is. The tip of the pen has a nice texture which adds some drag when used on the glass. The nib is not replaceable with standard Wacom nibs. I personally use a Wacom pen that I purchased for my laptop. It has the eraser on one end and replaceable nibs. It is the size of a standard pen, and obviously won\\'t fit in the tablets pen holder. I find it much nicer to write with than the provided pen.From an inking perspective, the pen is accurate for me. I\\'m left handed and I don\\'t have any issues with the alignment of the nib and on-screen cursor position. There is some minor lag if you are drawing fast where you may notice the ink takes a fraction of a second to catch up. It\\'s not horrible, but may be noticeable and annoying if you are expecting the device to be just like ink and paper. In truth, it\\'s pretty fast compared to other Wacom devices I\\'ve used. I *always* put a screen protector on my pen devices... while the glass is durable, all it takes is a small grain to get caught on your tip or eraser to make a scratch. I am using the iSmooth Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Ultra Clear Premium HD Screen Protector 2 Pack which is working out well.If you are looking for a case, check out the MoKo Slim Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch GT - N5100 Android Tablet, Black (with lip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty. It fits well and the brown leather looks nice in contrast to the white tablet. There is some talk about the magnets in many of the cases interfering with the s-pen, possibly even causing permanent problems, so I took an exacto knife and carefully removed them from the case.On the application side, S-Note is where the Note 8 makes the S-Pen shine. It does everything you would expect a note taking app to do, including the ability to export notes to a pdf for sharing with non S-Note users. The only thing missing for me feature in Microsoft One Note where it translates your ink in the background and makes your handwritten notes searchable.From a general perspective of tablet use, the Note 8 works fine. The lcd is sharp and has great viewing angles. Video playback is smooth and the device feels very snappy in general. I appreciate that Samsung still provides a micro sd slot... it is becoming too rare these days. As is normal for Samsung, they add in their usual bloatware apps that can\\'t be removed. While you can root the Galaxy Note 8, if you install an Android rom like Cyanogenmod you will loose the ability to run S-Note and many of the other tightly integrated s-pen features. Samsung tends to be stingy with their OS updates, and I\\'ll be surprised if they support the device after 4.4 Kitkat. The battery is good, but not stellar. Be careful with apps that provide background notifications/updates as they will chew away at your battery when the tablet is idle.In summary, the Note 8 is almost perfect for me. If Microsoft released a fully functional version of One Note for Android I would be in heaven, but it will never happen. The Surface Pro is just too big and expensive for what I need. At the current price, the refurbished Note 8 is about the same price as a good new 7\" tablet without a pen, which seems like a great deal to me.',\n",

So much nicer than my ancient 10 inch Acer. The aNote and WatchOn apps are brillant. The clarity of the screen (using a clear HD screen protector) is amazing. I still have much more fun ahead. You will need some time adjusting to holding this tablet, like any hand held device. My thumbs are occassionally hitting the back button (bottom right of home button).Beware that you probably DO NOT want to upgrade the OS to 4.2.2. The original came with 4.1.2, but when I upgrade to 4.2.2, the awesome Smart Dock turned dunce. Samsung Customer Service said that the Smart Dock isn't compatible, but there are videos of people having success with the Note 8.0 and Smart Dock...they were using Android 4.1.2 though! And there is no way to downgrade unless you Root/Flash the device (which voids the warranty). So buyer beware.So if you don't care about the Smart Dock incompatibility, then this is your tablet!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I've been using this tablet for over 6 months now and still absolutely love it.  In my mind this is the *only* mid-size tablet that gets pen input right, which is unique.  The digitizer based screen is a HUGE benefit and makes note taking or sketching very pleasant.  I use this every day for taking notes and it actually works -- fast and accurate.  AND one of the least-often touted advantages of the digitizer is the fact you can *hover* buttons in a browser, so pull-downs and other menus are actually usable.  No other tablet -- iPad or otherwise -- can do that.I have also looked at tablet PCs from Microsoft, Sony, etc but keep coming back to the Galaxy Notes as the best option for portability, features, app selection, and price.  Even now after the release of Nexus 7 and iPad mini retina I still think this is the best tablet for artists or note takers.  If you just need a tablet for touch, I agree with other reviewers that you can get a better bang for the buck with a Nexus 7 or non digitizer-based tablet.Of course, no product is perfect so here are some things I would want in the next version:- Higher res screen, 1080p or better- Bigger stylus with more weight (I bought a separate Samsung stylus, don't use the original)- Better battery life -- I get about 1 day with heavy use, 2 days with light use, 2.5 days at standby.  Would prefer 3-4 days of juice.- Better case/cover options -- the official Samsung case is flimsy and others are not as high quality as iPad equivalents\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"If I could I would give this tablet a rating  of 4.5 stars. It's not perfect  because I often accidentally press the power and return buttons. That's very annoying when it happens while I'm watching Netflix, HBO Go or when I'm reading a book. I'm using the Moko Ultra Slim Lightweight case  for protection but it has the power and volume buttons fully exposed. Other cases may solve my problem, but I haven't looked into it yet. The GN8.0 is also very expensive but it has the features that I want in a tablet. While I was willing to pay extra, I still wish that its price is lower.I wanted it for its size, good screen resolution, IR controller, and the S-pen. Like many of the reviewers here, I own multiple devices. I  have  the iPad, HP Touchpad, iPhone and the Samsung S3 but lately, I  tend to use the GN8.0 more frequently. The S-pen, with the Google keyboard, is very convenient for taking notes. I also like it when I can  easily switch to sketching with a precise pen.The remote control feature is also nice to have. I can control the home theater in the family room, the master bedroom TV and the TV in my sister's house.  It works with the Panasonic, Samsung and Sony TVs that I have tried to control. I don't know if there is a  limit to the number of devices I can configure. I will find out when  have visited my siblings and friends. Bottom line, I'm happy with this purchase. It meets my needs just right.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I was on the fence about this device but the in depth reviews on amazon convinced me to give it a try. I have owned the galaxy note 8 for over a month and can find no major fault with it. I was consdering the ipad mini 2 but since I own a galaxy s2  and other samsung tablets I went with Samsung instead. I  prefer the more open android platform to apples closed, tightly controlled devices.The screen is very bright and its quad core processer provides a very snappy response. I am getting 8 to 9 hours battery life by adjusting the wifi radio to shut off when in standby mode.i did have problems with the $25 google play credit but contacted samsung support on facebook. I received my credit within 24 hours. I also went with the box.com free 50 GB cloud service because there  is no time limit. Too many hoops to jump through with dropbox.  This  is a tablet for productivity great for students, business people and anyone wishing to organize their ideas.I am currently using the poetic slim case which offers good protection without a lot of bulk. I have odered the s pen with eraser as a second pen for note taking.  It is unfortunate that amazon prime movies will not play on this tabet, even with the adobe flash apk, only movie trailers will play. It has to do with adobe drm protection. I can watch movies with hbogo but not maxgo.also, I am using vudu and flixster to watch my movies. Vudu will do disc to digital conversionfor $2.So I can watch my movies anytime in the cloud!Sorry, I am unable to edit the double sentance below!

I like how the device turns on and unlocks when the pen is removed.  Pen location is located in the bottom right corner.  One would expect it to be at the top of the device, but being able to pull down instead of pull up seems to be more ideal.  When pen is docked, it blends seemlessly with the rounded corner.  Easily detaches by running your fingernail down.For the price, you would definately want to check into the Note 8 if you are looking at a Nook or Fire, as those reader apps are available on the Note.',\n",

I'm an artist, and thought I'd try this tablet out particularly for that.  I normally use Paint Tool SAI and Photoshop on Windows, but heard good things about Sketchbook.  This tablet is quick, and it's just the right size, but my way of doing things whether it's web browsing or art didn't match up.  Any art programs I tried missed one thing or another that were crucial to me.  This is the software, and not the tablet.  The only bad thing I could say about the tablet is the S Pen.  It's good and accurate, but the tip is plastic and slides around a bit too much on the glass screen.  It's also quite flimsy..I felt like I was goingto break it. (I push hard when I draw.)I'd keep this over an Ipad anyday, but for me, it wasn't worth the 300+ and sent it back.  Don't let my review deter you though.

I had a 3rd gen iPad retina display which worked fine but I never really loved it or any of the Apple products. I willingly handed off my iPad to my wife as soon as I got this. I study a lot, usually in epub or pdf format, and the Note 8 is great for studying. If you are a student, this is a must have. The S-pen functionality adds a dimension to the tablet market that, once used, is hard to do without. I find myself using this far more that I ever used my iPad. It's lighter weight and smaller dimensions make it easier to take with. My hands would get tired after long reading sessions with my iPad but the Note is so light that's never been a problem. The display is STUNNING and the quad core processor is very snappy! Sure the iPad mini is cheaper but the iPad mini is a cheaper product in more ways than just price. Take into account the 50gb Dropbox upgrade for two years and this is a no-brainer. The Note 8 in my opinion is the best tablet on the market. I'd recommend this to ANYONE no matter what their tech level.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I am a college student and wanted a supplement for my laptop. I wanted the everyday functionality my laptop offered me, but without the weight and process of setting it up. This tablet offers all the features that a productive student needs.The integrated spen and snote are simple yet elegant, making it easy to write notes on the fly with accuracy. Being a math major, I especially love the handwriting to text application for it can pick up mathematical characters and put it all into text. I am not just talking about multiplication and division. The spen was able to differentiate a partial differentiation symbol from the number 2 which look very similar. The spen is well polished and a joy to use.The screen resolution is not the highest on the market, but it still produces a very crisp and sharp image that is very pleasant to the eye.Being a former apple user, I learned that the Android operating system can be overwhelming, but after a couple days you get used to it. Overall the operating system is a lot more efficient than ios and a lot more fun. Also if you feel like the display is just too much, Samsung added the easy mode for the home screen which is a great starting point for those not as familiar with Android.Samsung has loaded this tablet with apps. Some will be used everyday while others may be left to the side and forgotten. The app store is well stocked with apps as well but definitely not to the degree as the apple store.Underneath the hood is a 1.6 GHz quad core processor with 2 gb RAM. What this means is that this table is great for multitasking. Internet runs seamlessly and loading videos is not an issue with this tablet. Unfortunately it only has 16 gb of storage with a decent portion of it already filled by the OS and pre-installed apps. It makes up for this by having a micro SD slot which can hold all your pictures, music, and videos. Also, Samsung has a partnership with Drop box which gives 50 gb of storage for 2 years.Cameras are decent but nothing special. I was disappointed that there was no flash on the back camera.The price is on the high side. It being $70 more than the Ipad mini can be a massive deterrent to many people. But when you take into account the amount of money you would need to spend to get an adequate note taking app and stylus for the ipad mini, the price difference definitely gets smaller.Overall a great tablet for those who want to be more productive. If you are looking for a tablet for just looking on facebook and playing games, then I would recommend looking at the IPad instead, but if you want a tablet that can supplement your work but still be a lot of fun, spend a few more dollars and buy the Note 8',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I had a samsung tab 3  8.0 and thought I would upgrade to the note 8.0. After using the note for a few days I'm really questioning why the price difference on these two devices. The note has a faster process but honestly it hasnt made much of difference to my user experience - it seems about the same to me. Even though i was well aware that the note has a broader bezel than the tab 3 it was still a big let down when i actually received the note in hand. In comparison to the tab 3 it truly looks and feels like an older model tablet. So for those who are all into appearance the tab 3 takes this one hand's down. The s-pen or my new obsession as I call it is a really cool device if you can get it to work properly. My experience has been difficult with the s-pen because when trying to write with the pen my hand is constantly pressing the return button as well as the other options at the bottom of the screen. So although I love the idea of the s pen I find it a little tedious to use, not to mention that the handwriting recogniton is little questionable. Again although I love theidea of the s-pen, for a user like myself who uses tablets mainly for watching movies, games and surfing the web I dont find it that useful for much other than being a stylus. Despite my comments I do like this device I dont think the price difference between the tab and the note is justifiable. The tab 3 gave me evrything that I wanted in a nice package and at a great price - I note provides features that clearly i can do without and which is not missed on the tab 3.  To each his own but after using both devices i would recommend the tab 3 over the note.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Galaxy Note 8.0 review.Very good tablet but falls short in some critical ways.I like the size and I find it the most functional tablet next to my Galaxy Note 10.1 except for some critical flaws that made me decide to return it.1. Bad baattery. Don\\'t know if I got a defective unit, but the battery life is unacceptable for my use (there was likely something wrong with the unit, but if there\\'s something I can\\'t stand in a mobile device, it\\'s poor battery life)2. 16GB of internal storage just doesn\\'t cut it for me. Without installing a single game or storing a single picture or music or movie, I was beginning to run out of space just after installing \"most\" of my apps, that I actually use, and yes I have an SD card (but everyone not living under a rock knows that since ICS Android no longer supports A2SD), and heck no, I have no intention of hacking and switching my external SD for internal SD (been there, done that and all the resulting problems are not what I have the time to deal with)The above issues were the biggest problems with it.Other things I would change are:1 Higher resolution screen with excellent sunlight legibility2 Make it even lighter3 Better robust speakers4 Add flash to the camera and equip it with better camerasI think if you get a unit without a bad battery, this would be really functional, assuming you\\'ll not be installing a lot of apps on it. I don\\'t think you\\'ll find any tablet right now that offers the utility in terms of taking notes and just being productive (besides the Note 10.1 if you don\\'t mind the size).It\\'s sad I\\'ll be returning it. Maybe if the battery was good I\\'d have kept it and lived with the restrictive memory.For now I\\'ll stay away from every tablet or phone with anything less than 32GB of internal storage. BTW, when your internal storage drops to about 2.5gb your phone or tablet will begin to lag. This is the cause of lag in a lot of devices. Keep you internal storage at about 3.5gb and you\\'ll likely see no lag.',\n",

The thing I regret is that the other site was advertising $25 google play gift card, which I just discover to be an offer from Samsung and not the site itself, and I had to pay taxes that showed up at the email confirmation.This tablet might seem overpriced, but it isn't. What you buy for $399 is a complete package which includes 2 year of dropbox (50 GB) for free... lets say $399 - $100 = $299. Now the tablet is like just costed about $299, -$25 google play gift card from samsung = $274. And now lets say minus Awesome note app which cost 5 dollars in iTunes, and the universal remote function... The price you pay is about $250 for this tablet + EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!Now lets talk about its performance:There is no worry about this tablet having lag or anything on the matter, you can compare it to the iPad and Nexus devices and it would run at the same level, although it (Note 8) has more software capabilities. The camera is really kind of bad when you compare it to the iPad mini, or the iPod Touch 5G, but would do the trick in good lighting conditions.The software really adds to the experience and utility of the tablet. The multi window function works without any fault. It is fluid and doe not cause problems. The S pen really can create awesome works and tasks much easier. Am going to download the PS Touch with the $25 gift card, and I guess the S Pen is really going to come handy.Am sorry to not have a really good structured review, but I promise to update it after a month of the note 8 usage. I also want to add that I have had an iPad, iPod Touch 5G, Nexus 7, and a Sony Tablet and currently an iPad mini.I definitely would recommend this tablet to any one, but especially to the people that are looking forward new innovative software. The s pen as a college student add a lot of functionality on my algebra homework (less paper to waist). If you just want a tablet for emails, apps and web browsing-- look at the nexus devices and iPad, but IF YOU WANT MORE THAN THAT!!!!t.. THIS IS THE TABLET FOR YOU. My review would be 4 times bigger if I explained every function of the s pen and the tablet it self. Feel free to ask any questions.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 for upcoming travel abroad so I could check my email, news and read books while traveling.  Laptop too big and bulky for personal travel.  Using an Android or I phone overseas is expensive due to roaming fees, but with a tablet you just need a WiFi connection, which are generally free.  So a tablet is perfect for travel. The 8.0\" Note is the perfect size for travel also ... the 10 and 12\" sizes would be too big and bulky.It didn\\'t take long to get the tab setup for my email account, homepage, and other apps I use on my laptop ... just a bit of learning curve.  Once I was setup,  I found that the tablet was a great substitute for my laptop with mobility in my house and outside wherever WIFI is available. When I was doing research for the tablet, I ran into a IT guy at a computer store who said he uses his tablet much more than his laptop when he\\'s on off site location, which is what I am finding.  So even though I made the purchase for travel, I find the tablet is so much better than I 1st thought ... A GREAT BUY!!',\n",

I need some help from a friend setting it up, since I've never used a tablet before.  I bought it in April; it is now May 21, and I take it everywhere.  It does everything I want and more.

It charges to 100% in around two hours. If I leave it on stand-by the battery lasts for many days without needing a charge.I also have an iPad Air that is just great. But I find myself using the Note more. I like the size, the sPen and the fact that I added a 128GB microSD chip which is really great, holds tons of books, video and audio.',\n",

I can honestly say it was one of the best academic decisions I have made, it not only spares me of the hassle of bringing paper and writing utensils but also saves me time (I can just take it out of my backpack, take notes, and put it back in). The S pen is absolutely amazing! And when I want to relax this tablet is great for just about anything, music, movies, games, web browsing. Greatest decision and will probably integrate the use of this tablet for the rest of my college note taking.',\n",

It is a nice complement with my Note 2 phone.  I just wish Samsung didn't take forever to roll out their updates for Android and I do not like the Touchwiz screen.  I use a different launcher program.  I can link my info from my phone to my tablet with ease.  I have used several tablets, including the new iPad Mini with Retina display.  I like and prefer the customizable platform that Android offers and there are so many free apps available.  Basically any app that is available to for iOS is available for Android.  Definitely recommend for students and people who need a lightweight way to take notes.  This stylus actually works to write with,versus the typical stylus that does not allow for very accurate note taking.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Pros:  - The pen  - The Screen  - Solid tablet in all other respectsCons:  - Slippery glossy back  - A bit big  - Price (but as a refurb, the price issue went away)Being older (though quite technical), I really never fully made the jump from handwriting to thumb typing. Having the ability to write my notes is much more intuitive to me that to hunt and peck at an on screen keyboard.  But, all the capacitive stylus hardware and software I have tried is crude and inaccurate. Basically a waste of time.  So I thought I\\'d give the Galaxy Note a try.  I have always wondered why, if Palm could make it work (albeit with a shorthand language) 15 years ago, why couldn\\'t someone make it work really well today, given the advances in software and processing power.  Well, Samsung seems to have done just that.  So while in other respects this tablet is really not noticeably different than other 7/8 inch tablets, for me, the pen really makes a difference.So why only 4 starts?  First, I reserve 5 for near perfect only, and this is great, but has a couple issues:  1) the smooth glossy back. It may look pretty, but it doesn\\'t give much grip. I prefer my (now given away) Nexus 7 in that regard.  2) the size - while 8 inch does give noticeably more screen size, it goes from being easily hand held, to marginal - really a bit big for long term holding.  I don\\'t have huge hands, but their not tiny either - probably average to slightly large for men. I could see this bordering on being a two hand device for women.  Again, I prefer the 7\" nexus in this regard.But in the end, the pen makes the difference. And as I bought this as a refurbished unit, at a deep discount - total price close to new \"normal\" tablets, I am quite happy.',\n",

I sat and waited for the next version of the Nexus to arrive but after over a half year, I started to shop Samsung. Things I loved: Extra real estate on the screen. Solid build and the pen software. Things I regret: Battery life is too short, The plastic casing is a finger print magnet; really I am a very clean person and the case looks like I ate fried chicken while handling the tablet. I purchased a case for it and this solved the issue. (New ones have a plastic leatherette finish which helps alot.) I am not impressed with the Samsung suite of programs yet. I did purchase Lecture Notes off the PlayStore which worked for me. I have an expansion card slot for more storage, but cannot seem to access the 32 GB card which I purchased. Not really sure why not.I keep the Samsung at home and carry the Nexus to the office daily.',\n",

Besides, I got it at a lower price from the other vendor. This thing is overkill for what I'll be using it for, at least for now, but I love the look, feel, and functionality of it. The 8 inch screen is the perfect size for me.  I have a 10-inch Samsung tablet that works great but I no longer use it because its too big to hold for long or to carry around. The Galaxy Note 8.0 is not perfect, and the price should be a bit lower for the features it has, but I haven't experienced any of the issues that some people are complaining about and I don't regret buying it.

I couldn't be happier with the size and weight of the Note, it is pretty much perfect for the games I enjoy, for keeping organized, browsing the internet, and keeping up with stuff on the go.  While I will never rely solely on the Note, it offers the ability to edit word docs, excel sheets though Polaris Office and with a bluetooth keyboard case I also got it will do on the go for anything conceivable I will use it for.With constant use it does get quite warm, especially noticab\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'l have been an apple user for many years.  I wanted a new tablet but I was not looking for an Apple product.  I researched the new Samsung Note 2014 10 inch and thought...that was the tablet for me.  I resigned myself to saving the money (cost is high).  But, on a drive home with my husband we started a pros and cons list...and I discovered that what I wanted was in this product.Pros:I wanted the S pen - I travel alot and need to take quick notes. A very quick settings change allowed me to have a note \"pop up\" when I take the S pen out.  For me, this is a big plus. I can write (amazing) a quick note and save.I am not a gamer,  so I needed my work apps to function on this tablet. They do!! My point is I was not looking for something that could process a game quicker, but allow me to work off the tablet with the S pen seamlessly.  This tablet does that.Lastly,  I was concerned about being able to function day to day on the new tablet...meaning can I access and complete all the functions that I did before (with my ipad). I am very happy with that.Cons:Connection to my WIFI can be spotty.  I carry a hot spot so I travel with the WIFI version of this tablet and need quick access.  I have only had to restart the tablet once when it could not connect, and have had some issues with the overall connection to a home WIFI. As much as I use it, I thought it was worth mentioning.Loading web pages can be slow (slower) - I only mention thia as I expected faster processing but WAS able to complete every task I neededOverall, I am in love, so much so I bought another Samsung for my son.Honestly, I cannot wait to research and find out more cool tricks that I can exploit to make my day easier.I recommend.',\n",

It is fast, easy to operate, especially with the hidden stylus ready to pull out for note taking.  You can even record, while taking notes!  The display colors are sharp. Photographing, videoing, recording, all of it makes for ease of tasks, and fun too.  The Note is so easy to carry.  it is so light, and fits right into your purse. Some models are phones, with simm cards inside.  I have the Wifi only.  The draw back to this is you must have Hot-Spot on your mobile phone to activate wifi in areas where there is no signal.  Of course you phone company charges extra for Hot-Spot each month.  I pay $20.00 to Sprint.  If it were operated as a phone, it would always be accessible to the internet through your plan.

Smooth graphics sweeping thru the homec screens or the apps.  I find that the size is perfect size for holding as well as to viewing video.  Video is a main reason of this purchase, and I use it for that daily.  The stylus is a great addition to have also.  Apparently WACOM styles technology is in this tablet and it's a steal compared to buying a WACOM tab separately. The one thing that's bothersome is the stylus, though precise, is not very accurate comparing the stylus point in relation to the cursor that corresponds on screen.I run Netflix and play my own movies transferred to the external SD card I installed.  32 GB gives you plenty of space.The learning curve is not that difficult for Apple die-hards.  I opened it up and just dove in.  I still haven't read any documentation that came in the box and VERY little of the online user manual.  I'm sure that would make me a power user.Battery life is great. You can get a days worth of use., but you may want to take the charger with you forman extreme scenario. Connects to wifi without much difficulty where I go.Mainly, this tablet is used for video and surfing the Web and not much more in the realm of any heavy duty use.My only issues are syncing my tablet to my same accounts on my iPhone and I can't edit my calendar through the Samsung Cal client.  My workaround was downloading the Google Apps and using them.\",\n",

Samsung proves that they not only know what people want, they can deliver it at a reasonable price. R.I.P. Apple, Samsung has crushed the iPad mini. The Note 8.0 is fast, versatile, light, and sharp looking. There literally isn't anything better on the market yet. It is the definitive tablet. Samsung proves that they clearly see the future, and unlike Apple...the future is now. There isn't a downside to the Note 8.0...everything from software integration to ergonomics is solid!

       "   u'Content': u\"I almost bought the 2013 Nexus 7 but decided on this one instead and I am so glad I did.  The s-pen makes this tablet what it is.  The Wacom style digitizer makes sketching and note taking a breeze.  I draw almost daily now where I used to go through spurts of occasional drawing because I would seldom take my sketchbook with me.  Now the sketchbook is always close at hand.For my church, I'm responsible for the leadership meeting minutes/notes and I found that writing on the note 8 is natural and less intrusive than something with a physical keyboard.  The handwriting recognition is pretty good for normal words but gets confused easily when writing out less common names/places or words unique to our faith.  Because of this, I've abandoned the handwriting to text to just handwriting in the excellent S-Note and Lecture Note apps for simplicity.  Less correcting of the incorrect auto-correct that way.  For short notes or writing in other apps the handwriting recognition is good enough.Other aspects of the tablet are fine. The IR port works but is kind of irrelevant to me as I seldom watch TV with it.  Screen resolution is plenty sharp for my near-sighted eyes.  The processor is quick and snappy and I've barely used up much of the 16gb (more like 8 or 9 after all the preloaded Samsung stuff).  I have an SD card to expand the memory but haven't needed much of that space either except for my growing collection of sketches.  The expandability is nice if I ever do run out of space.Overall I love the tablet as it allows me to create content easily and not merely consume it.  That capability from the s-pen and active digitizer make all the difference to me.  Worth the price.\",\n",

The size of the screen did not affect the quality of my view of the other apps like the S Note because the size of the notepad does not really exceed 8\".There were some revisions with the apps from the Note 8 that weren\\'t in Note 10.1 like the calculator which I can access from the home screen or the quick menu when in S Note mode (meaning when the S Pen is removed from its slot). I don\\'t know how to include the Calculator in the quick tray.  In Note 10.1, the calculator was accessible from the quick menu (tabs from the bottom when you use the ^ button).Also the screen capture is done via a hand motion which I\\'m still trying to perfect because once my hand movement touches the screen there is a tendency for my screen to change, hence the screen that I am trying to capture is no longer the same.  But I guess this will just need just a little practice.The apps on board the Note 8 (and the 10.1) are quite useful especially the Polaris Office and the Group Play.  Both useful in meetings and in viewing business notes and no need to transfer to my laptop as I can easily edit directly on the Note.Really love my Note 8.

I called Samsung and it was sent in for repair. About 2 weeks later I got it back at first it appeared the problem was fixed, but a month later the issue was even worse. I tried to just deal with because I used it for work and it was too much of an inconvenience to go without it for another 2 weeks.It got so bad that I finally just sent it back again for repair two weeks ago. They called me twice to clarify the issue saying they couldn't find any problems after running a diagnostic test. They're now sending it back to me and the work order says no issues found. Clearly they didn't attempt to use the tablet for more than 5 minutes. I'm very displeased with Samsung Customer service, if you buy this tablet you're taking a gamble on whether or not it's going to work. If it doesn't work it'll probably never get fixed.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I\\'ve been looking for a tablet which matches a definition of a device where I can write notes freehand on the fly and have the notes reliably transcribed in a usable format. Unfortunately, I\\'m still looking, after having bought and experimented with the Samsung Note 8. I will update my review in the future as appropriate, but at this point, I\\'m not happy.Using the S Note application with the S Pen for text recognition is an exercise in frustration. I tried writing a list in freehand, which would be transcribed into text. What I found was that it was difficult to fix transcription errors while writing, the transcription couldn\\'t keep up, the margins changed randomly and the text lines would shift.I looked for meaningful documentation that would clearly explain the functionality of the S Note application and I couldn\\'t find any. There are a lot of buttons and options, but no clear documentation. The videos that Samsung provides are interesting, but very peripheral and don\\'t really help someone who has bought the tablet and needs to do something with it. The videos appear to be mostly pre-sales marketing tools.A random annoyance is that the Google Now widget displays \"cards\", but upon clicking the widget, the device apologies that Google Search has \"stopped\".I already own an iPad 3 and was hoping this device would meet my requirements for a small device I could pull out for writing notes as needed. However I\\'m a disappointed with the Note 8 at this point.Update #1 (March 16, 2014, updating rating  to 2 stars): It appears the Google Now problem is related to a recent update.  A commenter on Google Search in the \"Play Store\" claimed having the same problem with Google Now on a Note 8. I had cleared the Google Search cache and data to no avail.  When I backed out of the Google Search update, Google Now appeared to behave correctly.Having dug around a bit more with the \"S Note\" application, I understand it better. Yet, challenges persist:1) There is a noticeable period (perhaps an average of 2 seconds) where the tablet is working on the text recognition and the tablet is not accepting input from the S Pen.  This results in a period where one is writing freehand text, but the tablet is not recording the writing.  This makes writing more than a few words at a time frustrating.  Understanding how the text recognition algorithm works and allowing for adjustment would be helpful here.  For example, it would be useful if I could set a timer which waited for perhaps 5 seconds after the last S Pen \"stroke\" before attempting text recognition.2) Looking at example \"templates\", the maximum number of words in the template appear to be a sentence or less. This would suggest that the software developers either didn\\'t design the application to handle more than a sentence at a time, or there are hardware limitations which makes attempting to write more than a sentence at a time difficult.3) A hope is that there exist other applications which work with the Note 8 that have a better text recognition workflow. As I learned when I wrote freehand text on my iPad, it\\'s nifty that I can write this text, but it\\'s not so nifty that my options for doing something with the writing (such as text recognition) afterwards are limiting.A different random annoyance is that when opening up Google News with the \"Internet\" or \"Chrome\" browsers, the screen appears to initially render completely, but all of the news and headline text disappears.In my experience, the automatic brightness adjustment causes the screen to be too dark or dim in many cases.',\n",

The hell what everybody talking bout when it comes to sounds its loud period so what the speakers are underneath the home button thats what the headphone jack is for.Secondly i ran a host of diffrent games and apps on this device runs smoothly. A glitch here and there but you wont care in all unless your just that petty to nag about this.Lastly the battery life is where you need to time the next charge , I use my for church reading and explaining verses and it runs great and keeps up with the leassons but after 2hours it starts to drain down hill so plan a charge at least 3times a day if u wanna get the benefits of this device.Long game play does the same so just keep the charger on it. In all its better than walmarts highsense7 its not to big perfect size and notes and the stylus is perfect for doing productivity work but the mulitple window is over rated using it for taking notes in class is a breeze as u get use to pulling it and being able to do reserach on formulas and problems as well.The price isnt as bad either think about it for all these features to me it just sounds like a solid deal didnt like the tab 10Nor the smaller version either but this was like home it just felt right ... if u have the cash for better use it cause u get what you pay for and its only better if u also grab a case while your at it throw in a bluetooth wireless keyboard and your good to go. Try poetic cases if your looking to add a great stand for watching movies or typing ....',\n",

I bought it to be dual purpose @ home and @ work where I take a lot of notes on the fly as a social worker (which is why I chose the 8 over the 10.1) and the s pen was the selling feature for me. The write to text and I are still having a few disputes because it doesn't quite understand my shorthand.  I am guessing there is probably away to train it that I haven't figured out yet.  Otherwise, it has been exactly what I hoped for, which is an integration of laptop functionality with the fun of Smartphone apps.  Oh, I also wish Verizon accepted the Note 8 in its data plan like they do the 10.1because I don't always have access to wifi, but maybe that will happen over time.  Definitely worth my $.\",\n",

It is not really significant and only on the bottom.  Called Samsung and they said it was normal for the Note.  Actually did some research and apparently this is a difficult problem that all companies face with regard to this type of screen-Apple included.  Most I suspect will not be fazed by this, in fact it only reminds me when I boot the device up.  Have not had any other issues with the Note as yet.  Have not had the time to really dig in under the hood and see what its made of to give a accurate functionality review.  Note, however that the battery for me anyway, lasts a long time-takes awhile to charge but goes a long way.',\n",

I also did not want to get locked into using just Evernote on the iPad. With the Note 8.0 I have the capability to take written notes using various note taking apps.I would definitely recommend this tablet for anyone who takes notes and needs that ability to share them. This is not your average tablet, it's mostly aimed folks who take notes, draw, sketch, color and so on and so on.If you are looking for an average tablet for casual internet browsing or checking e-mail, I would recommend getting a tablet like a Nexus 7 or a Samsung Tab.\",\n",

My main issue with that tablet was the limited onboard storage of 8GB.Granted it did offer expandable space with the min SD, but 8 GB fills up quickly.The Note 8.0 has 16 GB, though really ~6GB are used by Android. Perhaps there is a way to trim this, we'll see. More onboard storage gives me more confidence to locally store the 2GB of important documents that I need access to. The device also features the expandable mini SD, so I have plenty of space for media.The 8 inch screen makes a nice difference on viewing movies, playing the Tower Defense games that I enjoy, and even in the viewing of .doc or .pdf files. The S-Pen has become my primary mode for data entry and I use the tablet for all of my meetings and note-taking, it is that effective. I also author blog posts using the S-Pen.Overall, two BIG thumbs up on this device.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I use my note 8 mainly for work, at which I take a lot of notes.  I really enjoy the writing and pen feature of the device, but the battery life and the overall performance of the device makes me jealous of others that are at work who mainly have ipads or ipad mini's.  The overall user experience is a bit choppy.  Some apps that exist on both ipad and android tablets work smoother and faster on my colleagues' ipads (accessing hospital electronic medical records), and there just seems to be more support for the ipad versions of things than android.  This isn't a knock on all things android.  I like my device and plan to continue to purchase android devices (probably beyond Samsung now).  I just wish this device were snappier and the battery performance were better.  To give an example of the battery being poor, I've once unplugged my device at 6am after charging overnight, and by 10am, the battery was in the red after using the pen to write some notes for about 2 hours at 50% brightness.  It's a weird issue because it doesn't always happen, but does occur occasionally.The overall feel that I'm getting with this device is like when I first bought a Galaxy S1 (Verizon Fascinate) and felt that it lagged behind the iphone version at that time but after upgrading to the Galaxy S3, the device felt much improved and much more on-par with the iphone version at the time of the S3 release.\",\n",

It is plenty powerful enough for my purposes - browsing the internet, watching youtube, listening to music while multitasking, all that jazz. Samsung's software also blows away that of any other smart device I've used. The full-fledged toolbar in the notification drawer is a godsend and makes multitasking very easy. I love the stylus to death. I would never purchase a tablet without a feature like the S-pen after being spoiled by it. The tablet is a little inconsistent on the precision of tapping with the pen - usually it taps right where you want it to, but sometimes it is a pain. At any rate, the pen draws very smoothly. My only complaint is I wish the Multi-Window feature supported more apps. Not even Google Drive is supported, which is a huge bummer for me since I use that app more than most. Hopefully in the near future Drive and Firefox will join the list of apps supported.\",\n",

The S pen is very practical and convenient. I like to write/take notes, and I'm an amateur artist. Today I created my first drawing using the S pen, and it turned out pretty good. I'm sure that as I keep exploring the different functions and get more familiarized with the device I will become more attached to it. The only downside is that I'm unable to watch Amazon movies with this device, but not a big deal to me, as there are other apps that allow me to watch free movies on the tablet. As I understand it, the issue is with amazon and not this device. I am very glad that I decided to purchase the Galaxy Note 8 and not the Tab version.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. I design apps for a living and I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Tablet as a test device because so much of my negative feedback stems from this model. After unboxing the device, I initially had no idea what users were complaining about. The hardware is solid and beautiful and everything works as promised.Of course, this honeymoon period was short lived and now I cringe everytime I pick up this device. There are things that work fine on other Android Tablets that just simply defy explanations on the Samsung Galaxy 8.BLOATWARE:I should have known better but, true to form I too started to experience the same issues with Samsung that my users were experiencing. First, the sheer volume of Samsung \"bloatware\" that ships with the tablet is amazing. These are Samsung branded apps that take up storage space on your device \\u2014\\xa0that you might never use. Granted SOME of the apps are useful but most just take up space. It is as if Samsung doesn\\'t realize there\\'s a whole Google Play store that users can access anytime they need a new app. Yes, there is a micro SD port that allows me to expand my storage capacity but, it\\'d be nice if Samsung just allowed users to delete all of it\\'s bloatware if the user doesnt use them. Period. (Note that this type of behavior is not isolated to Samsung. Many device manufacturers -- from HTC to the Carriers do the same thing.)FIRMWARE and SOFTWARE (OPERATING SYSTEM) UPDATES:Unlike Google Nexus Devices, the Galaxy Note 8.0 is a slave to the device manufacturer. What this means is, if Google releases a new update to their Android software \\u2014 you can\\'t just download it and experience the benefits right away. You have to wait until Samsung releases their own version of the update before you have access to it on your Samsung device. Most of the time, its because they have to test their own \"bloatware\" to see if it works on the new update. If it doesn\\'t they need to retool their apps BEFORE they release the updates. If you don\\'t use Samsung\\'s bloatware apps, this can be more than frustrating.(Sure you can \\'root\\' the device and override this issue \\u2014 but, if you bought this to experience how most people would use the device, then rooting it defeats the whole purpose of using it as a test device.)CUSTOMER SERVICE is ABOMIDABLE:You may, overtime (for me it was within 90 days) start experiencing problems where your tablet starts to crash incessantly (you\\'ll see the dreaded \"Unfortunately Cloud Agent Has Stopped\" message.) When you get online with Customer Service they will run you through a script (this is true for most Customer Service centers) as they try to diagnose just what is wrong with your device as well as what they can do to fix your problem(s).However, if you\\'re an experienced Android user, you\\'ve most likely already gone online and done your due diligence and searched through user forums and found a bevy of unhappy Samsung Galaxy Note 8 owners with the same complaints/issues that you\\'re experiencing. Most likely that means you\\'ve already updated your software, already power cycled (turn it off and then on again), completed a factory reset and a myriad of other quick fixes on your customer service representative\\'s script.Having done all of the above, THIS is when your customer service rep starts grasping at straws to explain why your device may be misbehaving (phantom touches, screen lock-ups, crashes). And the solutions flung out at you range from blaming the magnets in your device case (which by the way is a SAMSUNG branded case specifically for the Galaxy Note 8) to blaming the micro-SD card (Im using a SanDisk Ultra) to telling you to delete all your apps and start from scratch (not a desirable process).MAYBE ITs A FLUKEHaving exhausted most of my patience, I decided (foolishly) that maybe my device was a lemon. One built on the last shift of the last day of the work week. These things happen. SO I bought a second Samsung Galaxy Note 8 \\u2014 this time from an actual bricks and mortar retailer (BestBuy) \\u2014 and just like my previous experience, it was great out of the box but, performance would start to lag in just a matter of days. It didnt matter that I killed all uneccessary tasks, was running only one app at a time, had RAM to spare, 10+ GB of open storage (more if you factor in the SD card), or even limited the specific apps I downloaded \\u2014 the NEW Samsung Tablet acted much like it\\'s twin I purchased online.Keep in mind Im not running anything out of the ordinary on these tablets, Im just using my Bank\\'s Bill Pay app, Readability, Facebook, Twitter, Mint, DropBox, Evernote, IMDB, Hulu+, Netflix, HBO Go, the Google Apps Suite (Play, Google+, HangOuts, Chrome etc.)RESULTS MAY VARYYet from the other reviews you read here, you\\'ll see some people are having a grand time and flawless performance with their Samsung Galaxy Note 8 -- so your results may vary. But for me personally, the Nexus devices work best \\u2014 the Samsungs are too tempermental for my taste. When they work, they\\'re a joy to use. When they dont work, I feel like flinging it across the room.',\n",

The stylus is great and durable.

Placing it in powersave mode, gave me about 7 hrs of use, taking it out of powersaving mode, will use the battery more quickly.I will say for the artists out there, you may want the bigger 10.1 inch due to a bigger screen.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'In short, if you like the Galaxy Note 2 phone you will like the construction of this device.  I found it well built, light, speedy and a very nice device.However, I\\'m going back to my Nook HD+ while I wait for a similar device with a better resolution.  After having using a retina iPad, a Nook HD+ and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 1280x800 or lower just doesn\\'t cut it anymore.  I\\'ve got used to reading a book where you can\\'t see any jaggedness to the fonts.  There is a setting to enhance the fonts a little in the Samsung display options, but it\\'s not the same.I\\'ve put mine up for sale.  Now don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s a great device I guess I\\'ve just become a resolution snob.  :-)P.S.  If you register at Samsung you are supposed to get a $25 Google Store credit.  Do a Google for \"samsung galaxy note 8 perks $25 credit.\"  I tried to register but it doesn\\'t seem to be functional yet, but don\\'t miss out on your free $25 of apps/books/movies,etc.EDIT:  Samsung is still having some issues with the $25 Play Credit registration, but they\\'ll get it figured out.  Someone made a comment about the Nook HD+ I must comment on; yep, it\\'s only a great device if you sideload Google Play store on it.  Anyway, back to the Note 8!  It\\'s really growing on me.  It has one of the best touch screens I\\'ve ever used, responsive, very smooth and really a pleasure to use.  It\\'s run every game and app I\\'ve thrown at it, and after playing with the spen a bit more it definitely is nice to have.  Cool to pull it out and have a note auto open and then just jot something down.  I still wish the screen were a little better, but it\\'s really a decent screen.  I would HIGHLY recommend this over the iPad mini, at least until Apple replaces the abominable 1024x768 screen in it.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I really like the Note 8 because it's more compact than my Note 10.1, but I'm returning it due to the low quality of the front facing camera. I do a lot of recording from my tablet and I take a lot of pictures as well using my front facing camera. The Note 8 front facing camera is only 1.3mp, but the Note 10.1 comes with a 1.9mp front facing camera. At first I was going to return my 10.1 when I ordered this one, but I'm glad that I waited. All in all this a very nice tablet, but for $400 I really think the front facing camera should have been better. My little sister has a Galaxy 3 phone and her front facing camera is the same quality as the 10.1, so I know the quality of the Note 8 front facing camera could have been the same or even better. I wish I could keep both, but I'm a unemployed student, so I have to go with what works for me and that's the Note 10.1. Most people don't use it for the camera features, so i would definitely recommend it for all the other features that it offers.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"The tablet itself works great and the S Pen is pretty accurate but hard to hold.  My biggest complaint about the tablet is my main complaint for all android devices.  They rarely get updated to new versions of the OS.  This one is already 2 versions out of date since it still only supports Jelly Bean.  Samsung only releases updates for their devices if it adds a feature that benefits them such as to support their worthless Galaxy Gear Watch.  My other complaint is each model has a different interface.  Makes using them complicated as no 2 are alike.  Samsung puts too many custom interfaces into Android and doesn't implement them across the board or update previous models with the new OS settings.While the tablet is excellent and great for the short term don't plan on it lasting for more than 2 years and it having no resale value at that time since it never gets updates.  I don't really like iPads but they have much longer life spans as they get yearly updates across the board.\",\n",

You would prob get this if you just want a device to compliment your already big note phone. But yeah it just didn't have anything special about it, like the whole air gestures is missing. for HDMI it takes a special cord that isn't at most stores.

       "   u'Content': u'Buyer Beware:  I purchased the Samsung 8.0, expecting to have 16 gigabytes of usable internal memory because Samsung and the dealerships advertised this tablet as having 16 gigabytes of internal memory. However, when I bought and activated this Samsung tablet, I learned that we have access to a little over 9 of those 16 gigabytes advertised.Now, I am not new to the tablet market and believe it is reasonable to expect 16 gigabytes of usable internal memory when the product advertises this memory and shows 16 gigabytes on the box in which the product is packaged. Therefore, I cannot help be feel that some level of false advertising was used here.The other storage-related issue that bugs me about the way Samsung packages its information is that when I purchased a product with supposedly 16 gigabytes of internal memory, it also sells the concept of  allowing me to add my own SD micro card of up to 64 gigabytes. This feature was a major selling point for me. This seemed reasonable to me since 16 gigabytes is not that much device memory anyway. So imagine my surprise when I found that the Android OS and some of its apps limit my use of that 64 gigabytes of memory on my SD card.Although the Samsung 8.0 camera allows me to change the storage  from the internal memory to the SD card, many other apps like the Google Play Books does not. Since one of the reasons I purposed the Samsung 8.0 was to read my purchased books on Google Play Books, I was very surprised and dismayed to learn that over 3 gigabytes of my usable 9 gigabytes on the Samsung Note 8.0 were taken up by five books. This is unacceptable.Ironically, I do like the overall speed, functionality, and form of my Samsung 8.0. However, had I known all these limitations to and misleading information about the storage size and SD limitations, I would not have purchased this product. I am only writing this review so that you have this information before you purchase this product. If the storage restrictions are not an issue for you, it is a decent product. Otherwise, you might see what else is available for you use. Thank you.',\n",

In simple if you like to draw and you like using stylus this is the tablet for you. Unlike most tablets that only allow you to watch movies & search the web. The galaxy note 8 gives you more options. You can watch movies search the web at the same time draw take notes even use a voice recorder to write for you rather than using a stylus (currently doing now). It seems a little pricey for such a small tablet but its packed with a loaded  with many options. is it worth to buy? It depends on you?how much you want to spend. Why spend $200 on a tablet I can only watch movies and play games? Rather by spending an extra $100, plus I recommend the screen protector in the keys with the Bluetooth keyboard, you have more options.  If you really want this tablet buy it. Instead of you wasting your money on something you regret buying. Spend the money now and get something you really want.\",\n",

It is slow and unresponsive and at times requires you to tap the screen multiple times as it sits there and freezes up. The battery life is the most frustrating thing about this tablet. At 350 bucks, how can samsung put out a device that gets 3 to 4 hrs of life?  Samsung knows about the problem and told me to lower the screen brightness and turn off bluetooth and wifi and updates and just about everything else. For $350 I have to basically turn off everything and squint to see the screen? What a joke. I got so frustrated that I sent the device in to have in repaired.  They kept it for a month and sent it back with a Software update. A month to do a meaningless software upgrade that I could have done myself? And the battery life is worse  than ever now. I've dropped 10% as ive typed this review. More than 1 percent a minute.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE! BY AN IPAD MINI OR NEXUS INSTEAD!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'overall a very nice tablet.  screen size is perfect.1.  what i didn\\'t realize until i got this home was that the 16GB version only has 9.87GB available space for storage and other apps.  where did the other 6+GB go?  filled up with lots of unnecessary Samsung bloatware.  one plus on this tablet is that it can support a separate micro-SD card up to 64GB.  good thing, otherwise you wouldn\\'t be able to do much with the limited storage.2.  i\\'m not a techie so i had not been keeping up with Adobe Flash players.  one reason why i went to Android O/S was because i thought it supported flash players.  not any more.  that advantage over the iPad is gone.  which means it\\'s frustrating to go to some flash websites and it doesn\\'t work.  then i have to run back to my laptop to access the website.  bring back Flash!3.  the pen was a draw initially but then i found out i don\\'t use it much.4.  Samsung\\'s S Planner app didn\\'t synch well with Google calendar so i had to download the latter separately.5.  big disappointment on printing capability.  you can\\'t print to anything but Samsung printers.  i have a Brother printer and so i downloaded iPrint&Scan; from Brother.  it was funky and clunky and did not print well at all.  perhaps one drawback with going with Samsung tablet rather than Google Nexus.  don\\'t know but i\\'m guessing that the Nexus probably supports other printers since their Android version is generic.6.  i\\'d take google voice over samsung\\'s any day.7.  loaded a bunch of other apps to make it \"complete\".  some of these really should be generic and native to android.some of my favorite apps include... - accuweather - adobe air & reader - amazon kindle - audible - bbc news - bloomberg - camcorder - compass - xe currency - dropbox - google earth - yahoo finance - firefox - flightaware - gasbuddy - gmail - google sky map - kitchen timer - google maps - merriam webster - netflix (it works!) - npr news - ny times - wall st journal - orbitz - overdrive media console - peel smart remote - realplayer - roku - scan - scribd - seatguru - skype - smart voice recorder - soundcloud - stopwatch - translate - vidcon - waze - youtubemaybe the next version of this tablet will be improved.',\n",

However, I had to return/replace the first tablet because of minor light bleed issue; unfortunately the second one's light leak was even worse. I am quite disappointed because this is absolutely not what I was hoping for in return of a big price (which could have gotten me almost two nexus 7!)If you ask me whether I will give up on Samsung galaxy note 8 for a nexus or ipad mini, I will probably say no because of the S pen option (And I have an Asus 10.1 tab already, it is great!). But for now, my plan is to wait at least another quarter for the price to come down, or for some other new S pen options to come out...And yes, I absolutely agree with others, that the lack of SIM card slot is disastrous!P.S. I am fascinated by the S voice function, it's hilarious!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Is there a 0 star rating?  Originally I rated this 5 stars....read on for the dire consequences....I am updating my review 4 months later after spending 6+ hours on the phone today with Samsung.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!At this point, I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!  Like NEVER EVER!!!  I just spent OVER 6 hours on the phone with customer service/technical support and remote-in people.  I believe that this is about the updates which totally ruin the device.  As you can see by my initial review below, I loved the device initially.  I did not do any updates for over a month, not even the initial ones with this replacement device from Amazon.  At that point, I was loving the machine.  Then, I found that the initial updates made irreversible changes, even with rebooting and factory data reset it did not solve the issues.  They also told me once you do the updates, the only way to get the \"known bad updates\" off of the device is to send the device to them for a few weeks for them to get it to out of box condition.  They refuse to send new device or give refund.  I started calling in mid January with these issues.  I was told they would be fixed with the next update.  Wrong!  Instead, things have just gotten worse and worse WITH EACH UPDATE.  More things wrong with every update.  Do not update your device!!!  Even one of the tech people says he has automatic updates permanently off.  I should have returned to Amazon in January as it was still under warranty, however, Samsung reps kept telling me the issues would be fixed with the next update.  Nothing got fixed.  Things only became worse.  MUCH WORSE!!!1. The S-Planner calendar in List mode puts your calendar items on the WRONG DAY.  But, it doesn\\'t shift everything to the wrong day, only some things, so you can\\'t just mentally think everything is one day off as you don\\'t know which items are on the correct day and which are on the wrong day.2.  I am bounced off the internet for no reason with the apology \"internet connection is lost\", however, there was no problem with the internet connection at the location I was at, it was the device.3.  I get com.android. is not working message and it bounces you off everything, internet and all.  Everything you were doing is lost.4.  The Awesome Note HD and S Note programs will just quit with no backup to what you were doing.5.  Polaris files disappear without notice after saving.  One actually turned all text in one file into a \"?\\' with a dark diamond around it after saving while Samsung rep was remotely connected.  They still won\\'t replace device.6.  There are tons of other things wrong that a Factory reset did not fix.  They want to take 4 weeks to repair and give me back the same device. Without my data of course, as that is of no concern to them.7.  Not a one of the Polaris files are in the document folder under My Files, not even the PDFs, not the ones I actually typed in, etc.  Good luck finding your documents when they are not where they are suppose to be.  But then again, they just may not exist anymore, so you better check for all your documents regularly to assure they still exist.8.  There were no documents in the my files section that were for Awesome note either.  I was told by Samsung reps that they were suppose to be there.  I can only see them under the Awesome Note application.7.  There are many more issues, but I am tired of typing about them....  It belongs in the scrap pile when you cannot even offload your data from it.I am tired of dealing with them for 3 months.  I have been on the phone for OVER 6 hours just today and I still have not been able to get my data off the device (with the help from both the tech support and remote help people) and they still cannot tell me how to off-load all my data to my computer.  What is with that?  Yet, they will take it back for 4 weeks to put it back to out of box condition, although all the updates will still be on it.  And all of my data that I cannot retrieve will be OBLITERATED!!!So, without being able to move my data off of the Galaxy Note 8, they are offering to wipe the device, (after I send it in to them).  They do not understand that I may actually need some of that data and that IT WILL NOT BE RETRIEVABLE AFTER THEY WIPE IT.BOO ON \\'EXECUTIVE\\' CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR SAMSUNG.  THEIR POLICIES ARE RIDICULOUS.  THEY CANNOT GIVE ME A NEW DEVICE TO LOAD MY DATA TO, SO I AM TOTALLY OUT OF LUCK.  I HAVE TO KEEP THIS PIECE OF CRAP BECAUSE I CAN\\'T OFFLOAD MY IMPORTANT DATA.  SAMSUNG does not know how to offload my data.  If I hear them say they can only do and such one more time (which includes throwing away my data, I will croak.I will note that I did speak to a couple of tech people and one of the remote people were very helpful in trying to get to the bottom of the issue, but when they leave you saying that they have to do further research to see if it is even possible, then there is no hope.  They connect you to executive customer service who tells you to send it in.  With your data still on it.  SamSUNG STINKS!  DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS!IF Samsumg finally gets off the stick and fixes this issue, I will re-post here, but I am guessing that this was a total waste of $400.00 and countless hours of my time as I have been trying to get this fixed for 3 months now.  I could seriously use that money for things other than a broken box.  I\\'m going back to paper and pencil, at least nothing happens to a paper calendar and paper notes, etc.  Daytimer here I come.  Larger sure, but you won\\'t lose all your data because the box doesn\\'t work right and the company won\\'t do the right thing and replace it despite their people not being able to fix it.Here was my original review:  Lots to love with this little tablet.  The pen, to be able to convert your handwriting to text.  Voice recognition, so you can speak to write a note in text.  Lots and lots of little surprises of what this device can do.  The 360 degree photos are great!Couple of things not quite right, so I am sending back for another:It says it is 16GB.  When you open it up it clearly says it only has 9.85GB TOTAL.  So get the 64GB card.The calendar is great and morphs into different views.  The problem is, in list view, things end up on the wrong day.  In the monthly calendar view they were on the correct day, list view and a couple of the other views, some of the items were on the wrong day, some on the right day, even when looking at one certain day.  Tried reloading, but nothing got this fixed so am getting another.There are times when the handwriting feature does not work, even when  try to put  in the mode.  Can\\'t figure out y.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'When looking at smaller-than-9-inch tablets, it really comes down to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and the Google Nexus 7 (2013).Both devices have enough RAM and CPU power to run practically any app or game.The Samsung Note 8.0 has a few pros and consPros:8 InchWacom digitizer and stylus for drawing and handwritingSamsung\\'s split screen multitasking mode that allows you to run 2 apps at the same timeSD card for storage expansionCons:not as high res as the new Nexus 7 and it\\'s an inch bigger so that even lower pixel density.  Not a big deal for me.  I have never had an issue reading anything on this screen and video still looks great.much more expensiveslower to get updates (the wifi version just got 4.2)  Not really an issue since most Android updates now come through the Play Store service.has a dedicated \"menu\" button instead of an app switch button.  A dedicated menu button means that you never know when a menu button is actually going to do something, where as an onscreen menu button only shows up when it has a function.  All Samsung devices are built this way, and it is a poor design decision.Samsung Touchwiz is kind of ugly, but you can install your own launcher and you will never see it outside of the system menu and notification shade.So for me the biggest drawback was the price difference.  I purchased mine and my wife Note 8.0 tablets as referbs and they work great.  But if you have to buy new, I think the price difference makes the Nexus 7 a better buy.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"The Galaxy Note 8 is fun to use. The tablet definitely feels  just the right size for a pen-based tablet,  it\\u2019s reasonably comfortable to hold one-handed and to use the stylus. The split screen software is great for note taking, the tablet feels fast and capable of running multiple apps simultaneously. The tablet could have had a higher resolution screen for the price its being sold at. The tablet build does feel cheap with its plastic build. Overall the tablet is expensive for what one is receiving. This would have been a solid 3 stars but when one is buying a product they are also buying the name brand and everything the brand stands for. Which leads to the whole $25 credit that one is suppose to get by registering the device. This was purchase at the start of June and still no code, made numerous phone calls to samsung, tried their online chat help, emailed them, even tried the facebook as someone on here suggested the only thing they said was it should take a couple of more days. Still no credit although $25 is not a lot of money but its the principal of it. It doesn't matter anymore for the tablet was returned thanks to the great customer service by Amazon.\",\n",

It comes with lots of bloatware which you can't uninstall without rooting your device. It does not have the latest jelly bean OS.On top of that, the 25$ credits offered by Samsung is a scam! I registered the device and contacted Samsung many times with no use.Samsung support is as useless as it can get.Not to mention they only offer 16 GB of internal storage! Be aware adding an external SD card won't help much as ALL of the apps default to the internal storage.\",\n",

I always purchased products labeled Prime, since I did not trust 3rd party sellers. Never had any problem.But, not this time. I just ordered this brand new Note 8.0 (Amazon website listed sold by Amazon LLC) under brand new price a week ago, and received it on Jan 21th. The item was packaging like a brand new. After a few setups, I could start to use it, and I really love it.But, then, when I tried to register it, the Samsung website said this serial number was already registered before.So, I called Samsung, they also confirmed to me this product was already registered before me. Obviously, Amazon sold me a used product (or a refurbished) which advertised as new and collected brand new price from me.I was really upset and disppointed, I am going to return it and will go somewhere else (Walmart, Bestbuy, etc..) to purchase another one again.Amazon, you are going to loose me as your customer.-- Larry --',\n",

I had to reinstall a game I'd put a lot of money into... a lot of money... when the tablet didn't restore the data from the game I went to the Samsung website and did a live chat with one of their representatives who told me that for some reason the tablet didn't properly save the data... duh... then he said it was a matter for the application maker and that Samsung would do nothing to reimburse me for the money lost when the tablet didn't save the data properly for restoring the game. I've contacted the application maker but I wanted everyone to know that the restore function on Galaxy Note 8.0 doesn't work and Samsung doesn't care that it doesn't work.
