The phone itself works well (I tend to like Motorola phones -- others may not) and the quad band capability should ensure compatibility with European wireless networks.One big selling point of this phone was Amazon\\'s claim that it was unlocked.  However, after trying two SIM cards from provides other than AT&T;/Cingular (one from an Italian provider and one from a Hong Kong provider) the phone is quite definitely LOCKED as it asks for a subsidy code when you boot up with a non-AT&T; SIM card.  So I will likely have to fork over another 15-20$ to get a code to unlock it from a third party.I think others have had similar problems --- as the phone was supposedly sold directly by Amazon (but I am sure they are using a third-party supplier), my suggestion to their quality control department is to pay a little more serious attention to this issue of selling locked phones as being \"unlocked\".One other thing -- it appears one may need to buy the software necessary to use computer-communication features on this phone (but I have not done a deep search on the Web to see if the software can be found for free --- what I know is my XP-system does not have a device driver to mount the phone and the phone manual indicates one needs to purchase such software).', u'Title': u'OK phone --- but it is *NOT* unlocked', u'Date': u'December 27, 2008'}]\n",
