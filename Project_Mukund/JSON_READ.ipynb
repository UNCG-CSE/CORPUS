       "   u'Content': u'I bought this phone mainly to use in Italy for extended visits and plan to get an Italian SIM card. The phone itself works well (I tend to like Motorola phones -- others may not) and the quad band capability should ensure compatibility with European wireless networks.One big selling point of this phone was Amazon\\'s claim that it was unlocked.  However, after trying two SIM cards from provides other than AT&T;/Cingular (one from an Italian provider and one from a Hong Kong provider) the phone is quite definitely LOCKED as it asks for a subsidy code when you boot up with a non-AT&T; SIM card.  So I will likely have to fork over another 15-20$ to get a code to unlock it from a third party.I think others have had similar problems --- as the phone was supposedly sold directly by Amazon (but I am sure they are using a third-party supplier), my suggestion to their quality control department is to pay a little more serious attention to this issue of selling locked phones as being \"unlocked\".One other thing -- it appears one may need to buy the software necessary to use computer-communication features on this phone (but I have not done a deep search on the Web to see if the software can be found for free --- what I know is my XP-system does not have a device driver to mount the phone and the phone manual indicates one needs to purchase such software).',\n",

Screen very legible . Comes with a good selection of standard utilities that do everything that I want a phone to do, and a lot of things for which I have no use on a phone(sending faxes, internet browsing, etc).  The phone has been extremely reliable, no problems whatever and has worked perfectly at all times.This is a phone that works on the GSM system.  There is no problem with GSM service anywhere in Canada where I live. European SIM cards for it are readily available, which allow for very economical local use in Europe thus avoiding very expensive roaming charges.  I have had no problems with GSM service when I am in the USA, but can only speak for the northeastern USA.This is a mobile GSM phone  It does not have bluetooth, it does nothave a camera. It is not an MP3 player. But it is extremely good at the basic function of any telephone :  sending and receiving phone calls.  Additionally, it has excellent sound quality and has been 100% reliable.As far as I am concerned, for what I want a mobile phone for, it hasturned out to be a most economical and an excellent choice. Highlyrecommended.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Pros:Battery Life (with the 1100 mah battery probably the best for a cell phone)Display brightness and colorKey spacing and tactile feelSignal sensitivity (much better than my other high end Nokia 6126, having a stub helps with signal reception vs those which attempt to hide the antenna)Smart Keys (make key functions for you accessible with one button - calculator, recent calls, etc.)Voice Dial (pretty good for a basic phone, but limited to about 7 contacts)Built like a tank (durable)Highly visible outside screen (even in bright sunlight)Not having to work in all the other gimmicks (camera, MP3) allows more focus to be placed on basic phone feature quality.Cons:Functionality of datebook limited (ex. can't repeat item for a limited number of days)Speakerphone not that loudCan't list multiple #s under one person's name in phone listings. (fax, cell, work, etc.)Graphics not that elegant but functionalUser manual really doesn't cover the more subtle functional capability of this phone.Overall, the best buy in a basic flip cell phone. A steal at $40 - $50.Obviously not for the person who wants a camera, radio, MP3 player, photo album, etc., etc., etc.Note: unlocked phones will only provide voice and text messaging services on any GSM network.  The service provider has to set them up to provide multimedia, web access and other services.  Many low end unlocked phones are last year's new but excess inventory for a service provider and will have their logo and service icons on the phone.  This is typical.  You also need the user manual for the manufacturer set PIN and other security #s to initially access the phone's functions.  User manuals can be found online at the manufacturer's web site.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I ordered this phone in spite of reading another review that stated this phone is not unlocked and doesn\\'t work in Italy.  When I first opened the package, my heart sank as I thought that my faith in Amazon had been ill-placed.  The phone had a \"Cingular\" logo on the front and was an obviously reconditioned unit with one small blemish on the side.  When I turned it on, I saw the Cingular logo and thought \"uh oh, locked phone!!\"The story has a happy ending however... In Italy, I bought a Telecom Italia (Tim) SIM card, placed it in the phone, and began using it with no problems.  As I type this review, I am sitting in Umbria with the phone at my side.  Definitely a very economical way to call home and call within Italy...10 cents per min or so within Italy to other mobiles, and about 60 cents to call the USA.This is a very basic phone, and many of the menus have leftover Cingular features which don\\'t apply (for example, their now-defunct MEDIA NET).  However, the phone is a nice size, makes calls, receives calls, easy to adjust the ringer.  Comes with a manual, charger etc.A plus is that this phone uses the same mini usb charger as my Blackberry Curve 8310 so I can just carry one charger abroad!I would recommend this phone for travel/vacation use.  For constant use, you might want a phone with more features and less Cingular-legacy branding.Hope this helps! Ciao!',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I ordered this handset with a wee bit of trepidation, because of the earlier reviews.  I received exactly the model described, though, right down to color.It claims to be a Cingular phone, but I've used it with the offered Mobal International SIM card, and with a US T-Mobile pay as you go account.  Both worked a treat.  It's definitely unlocked, as promised.All I want is a phone that can work in most countries.  I have other gadgets to take pictures, browse the web, and play mp3s.  This one suits, and at a most reasonable price.  The sound and signal quality seem about equal to any other mobile phone I've used.  Like most today, it's made in China (sigh), but the construction quality appears to be decent.I also chose the V190 over other models because of the warranty, which is provided by a third party, and because I was in a hurry -- it shipped directly from Amazon.  Sure enough, it arrived right on time.  Maybe they'll restock.The only quirk I found was the date and time displayed when I booted it up under Mobal - US West Coast time, 3 1/2 years ago!  Finally I found the setup option to set time and date manually.  The phone didn't tell me (until I asked it) that the European network I was on, Movistar, doesn't support time and date.  But that's a minor point.I should also note that while this phone will work in the vast majority of countries, it's currently not usable in Japan and Korea -- but then this is true of most GSM triband and quadband handsets, because those nations have nonstandard cellular networks.There are plenty of inexpensive mobile phone options for stay-at-homes, but not quite as many for international travelers.  This one can handle both chores with aplomb.  Recommended.\",\n",
